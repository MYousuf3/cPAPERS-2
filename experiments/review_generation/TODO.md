## ‚úÖ RECENTLY COMPLETED

### 1. Paper Content Extraction ‚úÖ DONE
**File**: `paper_loader.py`

**Status**: Fully implemented and tested!

**What Was Implemented**:
1. ‚úÖ Find paper directory in `extracted_files/{paper_id}.tar/`
2. ‚úÖ Locate main .tex file (multiple strategies)
3. ‚úÖ Parse LaTeX content using latin-1 encoding
4. ‚úÖ Extract sections: abstract, intro, methods, results, conclusion
5. ‚úÖ Clean LaTeX markup (equations, citations, figures, tables)
6. ‚úÖ Handle different paper formats and section names
7. ‚úÖ Comprehensive LaTeX cleaning (60+ regex patterns)

**Testing Results**:
```bash
$ python3 paper_loader.py
‚úì Found paper directory
‚úì Found main tex file
‚úì Successfully extracted abstract (444 chars)
‚úì Successfully extracted introduction (2764 chars)
```

**Features**:
- Finds papers with `.tar` extension or without
- Handles version suffixes (e.g., v1, v2, v3)
- Multiple strategies for finding main .tex file
- Robust LaTeX cleaning with 60+ patterns
- Preserves readable content while removing markup
- Handles missing sections gracefully

**Impact**: Models now have access to real paper content!

## üü° IMPORTANT TODOs

### 2. Test Phase 2 with GPU
**When**: GPU access available

**Steps**:
```bash
# Small test first
bash run_phase2.sh  # Runs on 5 examples

# Check output
ls -lh ../../data/generated_reviews/baseline/

# Review sample output
head -n 50 ../../data/generated_reviews/baseline/validation_baseline_reviews.json
```

**Validate**:
- Model loads without errors
- Reviews are generated
- Reviews are coherent and relevant
- Format is correct

---

### 3. Test Phase 3 with GPU
**When**: GPU access available

**Steps**:
```bash
# Run fine-tuning
bash run_phase3.sh

# Monitor progress
tensorboard --logdir ../../models/finetuned/llama3-8b-reviewer
```

**Validate**:
- Training starts without OOM errors
- Validation loss decreases
- Checkpoints are saved
- Final model is usable

---

### 4. Generate Reviews from Fine-tuned Model
**When**: After Phase 3 completes

**Steps**:
```bash
python3 phase2_baseline_generation.py \
    --model ../../models/finetuned/llama3-8b-reviewer \
    --split test
```

**Output**: `../../data/generated_reviews/finetuned/test_finetuned_reviews.json`

---

## üü¢ NEXT PHASE TODOs

### Phase 4: AlpacaFarm Evaluation (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

**Goal**: Compare Model A (baseline) vs Model B (fine-tuned)

**Steps**:
1. **Install AlpacaFarm**
   ```bash
   pip install alpaca-farm
   ```

2. **Create Comparison Dataset**
   ```python
   # Format: List of comparison pairs
   [
     {
       "instruction": "Review this paper: [paper info]",
       "output_1": "[Model A review]",
       "output_2": "[Model B review]",
       "paper_id": "...",
       "ground_truth": "[Human review]"
     },
     ...
   ]
   ```

3. **Set Up Evaluator**
   ```python
   # Use GPT-4 or Claude as judge
   from alpaca_farm import auto_annotations
   
   evaluator = auto_annotations.PairwiseAutoAnnotator(
       model_name="gpt-4",
       prompt_template="comparison_prompt.txt"
   )
   ```

4. **Define Evaluation Prompts**
   ```
   Which review is better? Consider:
   - Correctness: Technical accuracy
   - Completeness: Covers all important aspects
   - Specificity: Concrete vs vague feedback
   - Constructiveness: Actionable suggestions
   - Alignment with human reviews
   ```

5. **Run Evaluation**
   ```python
   results = evaluator.annotate_pairs(comparison_dataset)
   win_rate = calculate_win_rate(results, "model_2")
   ```

6. **Analyze Results**
   - Win rate: Model B vs Model A
   - Win rate vs Ground Truth
   - Analysis by paper type/complexity
   - Error analysis

**New Files Needed**:
- `phase4_alpaca_evaluation.py`
- `comparison_prompts.txt`
- `run_phase4.sh`

**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 hours

4. ‚è≥ Update Phase 2/3 to use real paper content

### When GPU Available
1. Run Phase 2 test (5 examples)
2. Review generated samples
3. Run Phase 2 full (validation set)
4. Run Phase 3 (fine-tuning)
5. Generate reviews from fine-tuned model
6. Compare outputs qualitatively

### After Training
1. Implement Phase 4 (AlpacaFarm)
2. Run pairwise comparisons
3. Analyze win rates

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
- **Full fine-tuning** chosen over LoRA for maximum performance
- **vLLM** for efficient inference
- **Paper-level splitting** to prevent data leakage
- **Llama 3 8B** for balance of performance and resources

### Assumptions
- Papers are in `extracted_files/{paper_id}/` as LaTeX
- Reviews focus on 4 aspects: originality, quality, clarity, significance
- Ground truth reviews are high quality (from NeurIPS)

### Risks
- Paper content extraction may be complex due to varied LaTeX formats
- Models may generate generic reviews without paper content
- Fine-tuning may overfit on 612 examples (need to monitor)
- GPU memory may be tight for full fine-tuning
