## 📊 Dataset Statistics (Phase 1 Results)

```
Original Dataset:
├── Total review entries: 1,000
├── Unique papers: 254
├── Average reviews per paper: 3.94
└── Entries with review points: 876 (87.6%)

After Splitting:
├── Train:      177 papers → 612 training examples
├── Validation:  38 papers → 131 training examples
└── Test:        39 papers → 133 training examples

Note: 124 entries skipped (no review points)
```

---

## 🎯 Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Data (✅ DONE)
```bash
cd experiments/review_generation
bash run_phase1.sh
```

### Step 2: Generate Baseline Reviews (Need GPU)
```bash
# Test with 5 examples first
bash run_phase2.sh

# Then run full validation set
python3 phase2_baseline_generation.py --split validation

# Finally run on test set
python3 phase2_baseline_generation.py --split test
```

### Step 3: Fine-tune Model (Need GPU)
```bash
# Run fine-tuning (3-4 hours on A100)
bash run_phase3.sh

# Monitor with TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir ../../models/finetuned/llama3-8b-reviewer
```

### Step 4: Generate with Fine-tuned Model
```bash
python3 phase2_baseline_generation.py \
    --model ../../models/finetuned/llama3-8b-reviewer \
    --split test
```

### Step 5: Compare with AlpacaFarm (TODO)
```bash
# Not yet implemented - see TODO.md
python3 phase4_alpaca_evaluation.py
```

- ✅ Multi-GPU support (automatic)
- ✅ Checkpoint management
- ✅ TensorBoard logging
- ✅ Best model selection by validation loss

## ⚠️ Critical TODOs

### 1. Paper Content Loading (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File**: `paper_loader.py`  
**Status**: Framework exists, needs LaTeX parsing implementation  
**Impact**: Currently uses placeholders; real paper content needed for quality reviews

**What's needed**:
- Parse LaTeX files from `extracted_files/{paper_id}/`
- Extract sections: abstract, introduction, methodology, results, conclusion
- Clean LaTeX markup (equations, citations, figures)
- Handle different paper formats

**Test with**:
```bash
python3 paper_loader.py
```

### 2. GPU Testing
- Test Phase 2 generation (needs 24GB+ VRAM)
- Test Phase 3 fine-tuning (needs 40GB+ VRAM)
- Validate output quality

### 3. Phase 4 Implementation
- Set up AlpacaFarm
- Create comparison prompts
- Run pairwise evaluation
- Analyze results

## 💡 Models Used

| Phase | Model | Purpose | Type |
|-------|-------|---------|------|
| Phase 2 | Llama 3 8B Instruct | Baseline reviews | Zero-shot |
| Phase 3 | Llama 3 8B Instruct | Fine-tuned reviews | Supervised |
| Phase 4 | GPT-4 / Claude | Evaluate reviews | Judge |

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Training (Phase 3)
- Training loss should decrease steadily
- Validation loss should decrease (watch for overfitting)
- ~3-4 hours on A100 GPU
- Checkpoints saved every 500 steps

### Generation (Phase 2)
- Each paper gets a review in bullet-point format
- Reviews cover: originality, quality, clarity, significance
- Average review length: 500-1000 tokens

### Evaluation (Phase 4)
- Win rate: Model B (fine-tuned) vs Model A (baseline)
- Expected: Fine-tuned model should win >60% of comparisons
- Analysis: Which model aligns better with human reviews?

## 🎓 Research Context

This pipeline implements the workflow:
1. **Baseline**: How well can LLMs review papers zero-shot?
2. **Fine-tuning**: Does training on real reviews improve quality?
3. **Evaluation**: Quantitative comparison using AlpacaFarm

**Research Questions**:
- Can LLMs generate useful paper reviews?
- Does fine-tuning improve over zero-shot?
- What aspects do models struggle with?
- How close are AI reviews to human reviews?
