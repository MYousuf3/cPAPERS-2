## 🚀 Paper Extraction Workflow (Now Understood & Implemented)

### Complete Pipeline:
```
OpenReview API
    ↓ (Get submission metadata)
ArXiv Search (by title)
    ↓ (Get paper_id: "1804.08450v1")
ArXiv Download
    ↓ (Download .tar.gz source files)
tar_files/{paper_id}.tar.gz
    ↓ (Extract with tar -xzf)
extracted_files/{paper_id}.tar/
    ├── main.tex              ← Main LaTeX file
    ├── appendix.tex
    ├── figure1.eps
    └── ...
    ↓ (Parse LaTeX with paper_loader.py)
Extracted Content:
    ├── Abstract (from \begin{abstract}...\end{abstract})
    ├── Introduction (from \section{Introduction}...)
    ├── Methodology (from \section{Method}...)
    ├── Results (from \section{Results}...)
    └── Conclusion (from \section{Conclusion}...)
```

### Implementation Highlights:
- **Directory Finding**: Handles `.tar` extension and version suffixes
- **Main File Detection**: 3 strategies (common names → \documentclass → first .tex)
- **LaTeX Parsing**: 60+ regex patterns for comprehensive cleaning
- **Section Extraction**: Multiple patterns per section (e.g., Method/Methods/Methodology)
- **Encoding**: Uses `latin-1` (same as existing scripts)

## 🎯 How Paper Content Works Now

### Before (Placeholder):
```python
paper_content = {
    'abstract': '[TODO: Extract abstract for paper 1804.08450v1]',
    'introduction': '[TODO: Extract introduction...]',
    # ...
}
```

### After (Real Content):
```python
paper_content = {
    'abstract': 'We have built an open-source software system for the modeling of biomolecular reaction networks...',
    'introduction': 'A central component of the emerging field of systems biology is the modeling and simulation...',
    # Real extracted content from LaTeX!
}
```

### LaTeX Cleaning Examples:
- `\textbf{important}` → `important`
- `\cite{smith2020}` → `[citation]`
- `$x + y = z$` → `[x + y = z]`
- `\begin{figure}...\end{figure}` → (removed)
- `\ref{fig:1}` → `[ref]`

---

## 📊 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Run Complete Pipeline (When GPU Available)

```bash
# Already done ✅
cd experiments/review_generation
bash run_phase1.sh

# Ready to run (needs GPU)
bash run_phase2.sh  # Generate baseline reviews
bash run_phase3.sh  # Fine-tune model

# Generate with fine-tuned model
python3 phase2_baseline_generation.py \
    --model ../../models/finetuned/llama3-8b-reviewer \
    --split test
```

### 2. Test Paper Loading Right Now

```bash
cd experiments/review_generation
python3 paper_loader.py
```

**Output**:
- Lists available papers
- Tests loading a sample paper
- Shows extracted sections
- Displays character counts

## 🔍 Key Insights from Data Collection

Based on analysis of the `data collection/` folder, here's the workflow:

### Files Examined:
1. **`collect_data.py`** - Main orchestrator
   - Retrieves submissions from OpenReview
   - Searches ArXiv by paper title
   - Downloads `.tar.gz` source files
   - Extracts to `extracted_files/`

2. **`get_equations.py`** - Parses LaTeX for equations
   - Uses `latin-1` encoding
   - Regex patterns for `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}`
   - Extracts context and references

3. **`get_figures.py`** - Parses LaTeX for figures
   - Extracts captions and labels
   - Copies figure files to centralized location
   - Finds references to figures in text

4. **`isolate_reviews.py`** - Processes reviews
   - Uses LLM to split reviews into points
   - Cleans messy output with GPT-3.5

### Key Learnings:
- Papers are in `extracted_files/{paper_id}.tar/`
- Use `latin-1` encoding (not UTF-8)
- Multiple `.tex` files possible (use `\documentclass` to find main)
- Robust regex needed for different LaTeX styles

## ⚙️ Paper Loader Implementation Details

### Directory Finding (find_paper_directory):
```python
# Try patterns in order:
1. {paper_id}.tar        # e.g., 1804.08450v1.tar
2. {paper_id}            # e.g., 1804.08450v1
3. {paper_id_no_version}.tar  # e.g., 1804.08450.tar
4. {paper_id_no_version}      # e.g., 1804.08450
```

### Main File Finding (find_main_tex_file):
```python
# Strategy 1: Common names
['main.tex', 'paper.tex', 'manuscript.tex', 'arxiv.tex', ...]

# Strategy 2: Files with \documentclass AND \begin{document}

# Strategy 3: First .tex file found
```

### Section Extraction (extract_section):
```python
# Multiple patterns per section
'abstract': [
    r'\\begin{abstract}(.*?)\\end{abstract}',
    r'\\abstract{(.*?)}',
]
'introduction': [
    r'\\section\*?\{Introduction\}(.*?)(?:\\section|\Z)',
    r'\\section\*?\{INTRODUCTION\}(.*?)(?:\\section|\Z)',
]
# Stops at next section, appendix, or end of document
```

### LaTeX Cleaning (clean_latex_text):
60+ regex patterns covering:
- Comments (`%`)
- Formatting (`\textbf`, `\textit`, `\emph`)
- Citations (`\cite`, `\citep`, `\citet`)
- References (`\ref`, `\eqref`)
- Math (`$...$`, `$$...$$`, `\begin{equation}`)
- Environments (`figure`, `table`, `algorithm`)
- Special characters (`\&`, `\_`, `\%`)
- Whitespace normalization

## 🎓 Research Workflow Ready

### Question 1: Can LLMs generate useful paper reviews?
**How to test**: Run Phase 2 → Examine baseline reviews

### Question 2: Does fine-tuning improve over zero-shot?
**How to test**: Run Phase 3 → Compare Model A vs Model B

### Question 3: What aspects do models struggle with?
**How to test**: Analyze generated reviews by aspect

### Question 4: How close are AI reviews to human reviews?
**How to test**: Phase 4 (AlpacaFarm evaluation)

---

## 📋 Remaining Work

### Only One Thing Left: GPU Testing

#### Phase 2 Testing (~30 minutes)
```bash
bash run_phase2.sh  # Test on 5 examples first
# Then run on full validation set
```

**Validate**:
- [ ] Model loads without errors
- [ ] Reviews are generated
- [ ] Reviews mention paper content (not just titles)
- [ ] Output format is correct

#### Phase 3 Testing (~3-4 hours)
```bash
bash run_phase3.sh
```

**Validate**:
- [ ] Training starts without OOM errors
- [ ] Validation loss decreases
- [ ] Checkpoints are saved
- [ ] Final model is usable

### Then: Phase 4 (AlpacaFarm)
- Install AlpacaFarm
- Create comparison dataset
- Run pairwise evaluation
- Analyze results

## 💡 What Changed Today

### Morning: Placeholder Implementation
```python
def load_paper_content(paper_id, extracted_files_dir):
    return {
        'abstract': f'[TODO: Extract abstract for paper {paper_id}]',
        # ...
    }
```

### Afternoon: Full Working Implementation
```python
def load_paper_content(paper_id, extracted_files_dir):
    # Find paper directory (handles .tar extension)
    paper_dir = find_paper_directory(paper_id, extracted_files_dir)
    
    # Find main .tex file (3 strategies)
    main_tex = find_main_tex_file(paper_dir)
    
    # Read with latin-1 encoding
    with open(main_tex, 'r', encoding='latin-1') as f:
        tex_content = f.read()
    
    # Extract sections with regex + cleaning
    return {
        'abstract': extract_section(tex_content, 'abstract'),
        'introduction': extract_section(tex_content, 'introduction'),
        # Real content!
    }
```

### Impact:
- **Before**: Models only saw paper titles
- **After**: Models see abstract + introduction + methods + results + conclusion
- **Quality**: Clean, readable text (LaTeX commands removed)
- **Coverage**: Works with different LaTeX styles and structures
