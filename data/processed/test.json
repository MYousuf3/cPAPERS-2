    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the detailed and insightful comments. Regarding the comment:\n\n- MSE metric:\n  * In Table 2, we evaluate the MSE of the different (approximate) kernel regression methods on the test dataset, not the kernel approximation quality. For the final version of our paper, we will make sure to add a separate kernel approximation experiment with the suggested norm evaluation.\n\n\n\n- Tighter bound with delta and epsilon:\n  * Our NTK Sketch is constructed by recursively composing various independent sketch matrices and we analyzed it by various applications of the union bound and triangle inequality, which might be loose. In other words, in our analysis, we always assumed that the errors of different sketch matrices accumulate in the worst case while in reality, since the sketch matrices are independent, we should get a random walk on the real line. However, we leave a tight analysis of our sketches as an open question for future works. \n\n\n\n- Missing reference:\n  * Thanks a lot for pointing this out. We will update our references.\n\n\n\n- Continuity of feature map:\n  * Our analysis of the spectral approximation relies on Theorem 3.3 in [Lee et al., 2020], which does not require continuity of the feature map. The proof is mainly based on some version of the matrix Bernstein inequality and its only requirement is the finiteness of the integral of the leverage score function. All feature maps in our paper satisfy this condition.\n\n    [Lee et al., 2020] Lee, Jason D., et al. Generalized Leverage Score Sampling for Neural Networks.

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the detailed and insightful comments. Regarding the comment:\n\n- Unconvinced motivation: \n  * We agree with the reviewer that the kernel methods in general have lost some of their practical relevance in recent years and deep learning has replaced them in many applications. We view NTK as one of the most promising directions for bringing the kernel methods back to some applications again. The main obstacle to this is the slow runtime of the kernel based learning with NTK and our paper tries to address this issue.\nWe remark that although the NTK does not currently perform as well as deep neural networks, it does not require training (possibly huge) parameters of a network and it would be exciting to have a purely untrained kernel based model that works reasonably well and fast.\nMoreover, recent works study interesting practical applications of the NTK such as active learning [Shoham et al., 2020] and neural architect search [Chen et al., 2021]. However, these literature commonly point out the computational problem of the NTK. Our motivation on accelerating the NTK is thus clear and convincing to us.\n\n    [Shoham et al., 2021] Shoham, Neta, and Haim Avron.

    "review": "Overall, this manuscript has nice results, though as written it feels like the big step/insight was in ref. [1] where the sketches are constructed. The main contribution here is then showing/observing the requisite structure is present in the (C)NTK. As the structure of the NTK is from prior work (e.g., refs. [9] and [12]) it does feel like some of the more substantial contributions relate to observations about the CNTK, (limited) spectral approximation bounds, and showing a level of numerical feasibility. I do think there are some improvements that could be made to the manuscript to better explain aspects of these contributions\n\nIn section 4 the authors note that there are specific structural observations they make about the CNTK that allow it to be efficiently sketched. Do those observations alone yield a faster algorithm than what is cited from [5]? Additionally, while the dependence on $d_1$ and $d_2$ is better than [5] the cost is worse in L and an epsilon is introduced. Thinking of the image sized as fixed (which seems reasonable in certain settings), this means there is a network depth (or desired accuracy) at which point the exact computation is seemingly preferable; is that the case? and how should that trade-off be evaluated?\n\nIn the numerical results the authors have to pick parameters (beyond just the final feature size), how are these chosen? Moreover, even the final feature size does not necessary seem to be directly guided by the theoretical results (i.e., the theory suggests larger sketch sizes may be warranted) the paper shows the sketch sizes chosen yield decent results. Is there some \"practical guidance\" that could be applied here? How were other internal parameters (e.g., in Alg. 1) chosen?\n\nIn some of the algorithms there are two distinct steps: (1) approximation by a polynomial kernel and (2) a specially designed sketch for that kernel. While the polynomial kernel order is chosen adaptability, is that \"convergence\" with epsilon balanced with the sketch convergence? Roughly speaking, as \\epsilon -> 0 would the method, at some point, be reasonably thought of as using an \"exact\" polynomial kernel? and, if so, what are the implications of that? Some of the properties of the NTK cited by the authors (e.g., generalization) depend on kernel properties such as minimal eigenvalues. The behavior of some of those properties could look quite different for a smooth polynomial kernel vs the less smooth zonal kernel induced by ReLU. This presumably relates to the authors informal discussion of regularization effects.\n\nWhile I think it is reasonable that this paper sets itself in the \"NTK regime\" and is presented as a computational improvement for that setting, it may be reasonable for the paper to briefly note that the NTK regime is not fully descriptive. See, e.g., When Do Neural Networks Outperform Kernel Methods? by Ghorbani et al. NeurIPS 2020 and references therein.\n\nAssorted comments/suggestions/questions:\n\n- In places the authors rely a bit too much on \"inheriting\" information from ref. [5]. For example, Theorem 4 explicitly calls out a model defined in [5] as do some of the CNTK numerical experiments. These details seem important enough that they warrant inclusion somewhere in this work (e.g., the supplement) so that the reader can actually see what the models are.\n\n- Early in the intro $x_i$ is introduced as a $d \\times d$ image and then later is generically a d dimensional vector. I think it would be better to keep x as a d-dimensional vector and reserve some other letters for matrix/tensor representations of images to avoid potential confusion (similarly, maybe it is better if images are always $d_1 \\times d_2$ to avoid overloading d).\n\n- Should eq. (12) have the inequality flipped or a $1-\\delta$ on the right hand side?\n\n- On line 136 the abbreviation DP used later for dynamic program should be properly \"defined.\"\n\n- The manuscript could be a bit more clear about what all operations are explicitly included in the timing reported. There is a brief note on this in 5.3, but what about for the CNTK?\n\n- The manuscript may benefit from having a bit more notation introduced earlier on. This would make it easier to talk concretely about kernel learning, features maps, etc. \n",
    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the detailed and insightful comments. Regarding the comment:\n\n- Feels like the big step/insight was in ref [1] where the sketches are constructed:\n  * Our sketching method works by first approximating the arc-cosine kernels in each layer of the network by a polynomial and then applying dimensionality reduction using the PolySketches proposed in ref [1]. We then combine the resulting features of arc-cosine kernels in consecutive layers of the network using the PolySketch. Furthermore, our random features method works in the same fashion except that we approximate the arc-cosine kernel by random features sampling as opposed to polynomial expansion. If we focused on a single layer of the network then it might appear that most of the analysis relies on the guarantees of the PolySketch presented in ref [1]. However, we need to analyze a multi-layered network where the sketched output of one layer is fed to the next layer and bounding the effects of errors from previous layers in the output of each layer is non-trivial. While our algorithm heavily relies on the PolySketch, the analysis of our method is completely new and does not immediately follow from prior works.\n\n\n\n\n- Structural observation of CNK: \n  * Our structural observations about CNTK do not imply a faster kernel computation than the DP given in [5] and only enable our low-rank kernel approximation.\nAdditionally, exact computation of CNTK requires $\\mathcal{O}(L (d_1 d_2)^2)$ operations. This means that computing the kernel matrix for a dataset of $n$ images requires $\\mathcal{O}(L (d_1 d_2)^2 \\cdot n^2)$ operations. Our method does not need to compute the kernel matrix anymore and one can simply transform each of the data points to the (approximate) feature space using our method and then run linear learning methods such as kernel ridge regression on the transformed data points. Transforming $n$ images using our method takes $\\mathcal{O}(L^{11}/\\varepsilon^{6.7} \\cdot (d_1 d_2) \\log^3(n) \\cdot n)$ and since our feature dimension is only $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n) / \\varepsilon^2)$, we can run approximate KRR using the same asymptotic runtime. This is faster than exact CNTK computation in two ways: our method scales linearly in n as opposed to quadratic; our method scales linear in the number of pixels $(d_1 d_2)$ as opposed to quadratic. We will emphasize this in the intro section.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Parameter choice:\n  * For our random features method, while the theoretical result involves 3 distinct parameters, which are the target dimension of the PolySketch and the number of random features sampled for arc-cosine kernels of order 0 and 1, to simplify things in practice we set all these quantities to be equal to the final feature size. This way there is no hyperparameter and we only need to choose our desired final feature size.\nFor our (C)NTK Sketches, there are various hyperparameters such as the target dimensions of the intermediate sketch matrices that we use. To simplify the algorithm in practice we set all target dimensions of all sketch matrices in our algorithm to be equal to the final target dimension. This gets rid of most hyperparameters. \nThe only hyperparameter left is the degree of the polynomial we use to approximate the arc-cosine kernels, i.e., the degrees of $P_{relu}^{(p)}(\\cdot)$ and $\\dot{P}_{relu}^{(p)}(\\cdot)$ in Eq (6). We choose the degree from the set {$2, 4, 8$} by running a hyperparameter search with cross-validation on the training data. However, our practical guidance is that choosing a polynomial degree of 4 works well, almost always. We will add these details of the practical guidance in our final draft.\n\n- Does convergence with epsilon balance polynomial and sketch?\n  * In the analysis of our (C)NTK Sketch, $\\varepsilon$ controls the errors of both polynomial approximation of the arc-cosine functions and the skekching of the resulting polynomial kernels. More specifically, $\\varepsilon$ controls the degree of the polynomials in Eq (6) of Algorithm1 (i.e., $p,p\u2019$) as well as the target dimensions of various sketch matrices in Algorithm 1. Hence, $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$ implies infinite degree polynomials and infinite sketching dimension, thus both of these approximations become exact. \n\n\n\n\n- Usage of \u201cNTK regime\u201d:\n  * We agree that the NTK regime is not fully descriptive and do not intend to claim that our work can in any way replace the trained neural networks. We believe that learning with NTK kernels is one of few promising research directions that can increase the practical relevance of kernel methods. So, our paper tries to lift one of the main obstacles in kernel-based learning with NTKs which was their slow runtime. We will add a remark that clearly describes our setting in the intro.\n\n\n\n- We will also update all typos and minor issues in our final manuscript.\n",

    "review": "I think that DD is still not well understood, and studying it is important and interesting. Also, the connection between DD and certain parameters of the data or optimization is an interesting observation. On the other hand, I think this paper makes a weak case for why these parameters actually affect DD, especially on the experimental part, and vaguely connects the theory presented in the paper with the experiments. In more details:\n\nFor the theoretical part:\n1) I think the main idea is nice, studying linear regression in the case where d>n (more parameters than data examples), which is a less studied case in the literature. \n\n2) Viewing section 2 as a whole, it is hard to grasp a single conclusion on how the excess risk behaves. It would have been much clearer if there was a single theorem that shows a bound on the excess risk when d goes to infinity. In both theorems 2 & 3, there are terms where it is not clear how they behave (e.g. E[||w^*||^2]_{I-M}).\n\n3) To emphasize the previous point, two parameters are considered (n and d), and throughout the section it is unclear which one is considered to be larger. I assume the authors meant that d>n (since this is the over-parameterized case), but in line 163 (and Appendix F) it seems the E[||w^*||^2]_{I-M} term only goes to zero with large n, as well as the noise in Theorem 3. What happens in the over-parameterized regime when n is fixed and d goes to infinity? I think this is the interesting case when studying DD.\n\n4) Section 3 is very unclear. What are the assumptions made in the equation after line 216? What are the main conclusions of this section? There are very long paragraphs, where the bottom line isn\u2019t clear.\n\nFor the empirical part\n1) I think this is the main weak point of the paper. The connection between the experiments and the theory is not well grounded. Also, the experiments are very lacking and not convincing enough.\n\n2) To emphasize, the theoretical part focuses on a certain eigenvalue of the data matrix. This eigenvalue has no connection at all to the optimization process and is fixed. On the other hand, in the theoretical part the authors consider the eigenvalue of the output of some intermediary layer, which changes through the optimization process. Why not take the eigenvalue of the data itself? And if the authors already decide to take the eigenvalue of an intermediary layer, I suggest taking the eigenvalue of all layers and comparing them. \n\n3) The only datasets used are MNIST and FashionMNIST which I think are very small and not very hard to learn, even with simple models. To give a more convincing argument I suggest using larger and harder datasets (e.g. CIFAR 10/100, ImageNet).\n\n4) The models considered are very small, e.g. one hidden layer and three hidden layers. I suggest experimenting on more realistic models and see if this eigenvalue has the same effect. Also, to experiment on other architectures such as ConvNets.\n\n5) There are no experiments on regularization (e.g. L1/L2, Dropout, BatchNorm). Regularization techniques might mitigate the effect of this eigenvalue on the DD phenomenon. Without these experiments, it is hard to evaluate whether this phenomenon is due to the effects of this eigenvalue, or some other property that can be mitigated using regularization techniques.\n\n6) In line 308 it says that ablation studies are in Appendix H. The only experiment in Appendix H is a three-layer network with or without skip connections. I suggest adding significantly more ablation studies to give a more convincing case.\n\nSome more issues:\n\n1) Why do the authors show the experiments for a different number of iterations? The reason is not explained in the paper, this is very confusing and takes three times as much space. I think the point of DD is looking at a trained model, if the authors want to emphasize some idea for an untrained model (e.g. after T=1000 iterations) then they should explain it.\n\n2) There are confusing notational issues throughout the paper: the parameters alpha and T are shown in the introduction, but are defined only in section 2. Some notations are used in the main part of the paper, but are only defined in the appendix (e.g. ||A||_M norm). It is OK to define some notations in the appendix, but if something appears in the main part of the paper, then I think it should be defined there.\n\n3) Line 131, what does it mean that \\Delta and W_0 are independent? Each coordinate of W_0 is i.i.d Gaussian, so how can it be dependent on \\Delta. Is it meant to be that \\Delta is independent of d?\n\n4) In all the theorems, why is W_0 upper case? This is a vector, and the notations state that vectors are lower case, also w and w^* are lower case.\n\n5) The figures are extremely small and hard to read. I suggest the authors to remove the different number of iterations experiments and just show how the trained model behaves, this will save much space and will allow to give much bigger and clearer figures.\n\n6) In lines 699-700 it states that \u201cthe deeper the network the harder it is to train them\u201d, while Figure 6 shows the opposite, that deeper networks achieve smaller test error. \n\n7) The title is \u201cOn the Role of Optimization in Double Descent..\u201d, while the paper studies how a certain eigenvalue of the data matrix affects DD. \n\n8) The \"related work\" section is in the appendix. Although this is allowed, in my opinion, this is bad practice. This section is a crucial part of the paper and helps the reader to evaluate its contribution and novelty, based on previous works that were done in the same area.\n\nSome typos and other minor issues:\n\n1) Sometimes \u201coptimization\u201d is used and other times \u201coptimisation\u201d. Both are OK, but the authors should be consistent and choose one form.\n\n2) Title of Section 3: parammeterization \u2192 parameterization\n\n3) In figure 1, \u201cThe first row demonstrates behavior of (1)...\u201d what is (1)? The hyperlink points to the introduction section.\n\n4) First sentence of appendix F, should it be the over-parameterized case?\n\n\nTo improve the paper I suggest making a more thorough experimental study. This includes more realistic datasets, different architectures, Verify whether the conclusions hold with different regularization schemes, and conduct more ablation studies. Also, to connect the empirical results to the theoretical study I suggest looking at different architectures and network depths, and calculate the eigenvalue for more intermediary layers (including for the data itself). It will also help if the theoretical part will have a single corollary or theorem on how the excess risk behaves when d->\\infty, without any unclear terms such as E[||w^*||^2]_{I-M}.\n\n-------------Update after rebuttal---------------\n\nAfter reading the author's response my concerns remain, and I retain my score.",
    "comment": "* Many thanks for your detailed comments. We disagree however on deeming the empirical part of our work as the main weak point. While we agree that more questions can be answered with further and more extensive experiments, we think our work presents an interesting perspective on DD phenomena that merits attention of the neurips community.\n\n* We agree with the reviewer that the fact that the eigenvalue we are reporting are subject to change through optimization, which makes it different that the theoretical setting studied in the previous sections. However, the point of view we adopted (feature extractor + linear predictor) is the closest to the theoretical analysis. For this reason, we report only the eigenvalue of the penultimate layer (and not any intermediary layer), and we report the eigenvalue at multiple stages of the optimization. This shows that the curve of the behavior of the smallest eigenvalue doesn't change with the optimization. We will make this clearer in the paper.\n\n* It is known that a suitably chosen strength of regularization can mitigate the \"peak\" in the DD curves. However, our focus is not on how to mitigate DD when it happens, but rather on proposing an explanation that when DD happens, it is due to an effect of the optimization. Note also that all the networks are trained with plain gradient descent and not SGD to avoid the effect of implicit regularization, and keep the experiments as close as possible to the least-squares setting studied in our theory.\n\n* We will use your feedback to clarify obscure points and we will correct the pointed out typos. We will make an effort to declare the used notation, and will insert more cross-references for improving the readability. We will also improve the figures as per your suggestion.\n\n* Comment that the role of $\\mathbb{E}[||\\mathbf{w}^{\\star}||^2]_{\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{M}}$ is unclear.. \n  * The role of term $\\mathbb{E}[||\\mathbf{w}^{\\star}||^2]_{\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{M}}$ is explained in the main text: It corresponds to the squared length of the projection of $\\mathbf{w}^{\\star}$ onto the subspace not spanned by the data. This term is non-zero only when $d > n$, and decays as $1/\\sqrt{n}$ when the tail of eigenvalues has a polynomial decay (see appendix F).\n\n* The meaning of independence of $\\Delta$ and $\\mathbf{W}_0$ is that their joint distribution equals the product of the marginal distributions (i.e. this refers to \"stochastic independence\" and not to independence of the algebraic expressions), this will be emphasized in the revised paper. We write $\\mathbf{W}$ when this is a random vector (i.e. it has a probability distribution) and we write $\\mathbf{w}$ when this is a non-random vector, both cases in boldface to indicate that they are vectors. We will clarify this convention in the notation section. Also note that our labels for matrices ($\\mathbf{A}$, $\\mathbf{M}$) do not conflict with the labels we use for random vectors ($\\mathbf{W}$). In the end, making explicit the space of each kind of object ($\\mathbb{R}^{p \\times q}$ with suitable positive integers $p$ and $q$) should rule out any confusion, then vectors and matrices are not too different from each other (think of the case $q=1$).  We will do our best to clarify our notation conventions this in the notation section, and to insert reminders throughout the paper, in the revised version.\n\n* Regarding the effect of depth, your comment (point 6 under some more issues) made us realize that there is a typo in Figure 6. In this figure we report test accuracy and not test error. This will be corrected. Thank you very much.\n\n* We agree that more experiments are needed in order to gain better understanding, with more datasets and more models with different modern components. However, in this paper we chose to explore whether the insights from the least squares learning problem are transferable to neural networks. We believe that the observations drawn from our experiments are interesting to the community. Understanding the impact of other factors that can change the network behavior (and the smallest eigenvalue of the penultimate layer), such as initialization, the optimizer choice and regularization, is important but left to a future work.\n",

This eigenvalue has no connection at all to the optimization process and is fixed.

Regularization techniques might mitigate the effect of this eigenvalue on the DD phenomenon. Without these experiments, it is hard to evaluate whether this phenomenon is due to the effects of this eigenvalue, or some other property that can be mitigated using regularization techniques.\",\n    \"6) In line 308 it says that ablation studies are in Appendix H.

    "review": "This paper tries to study and explain the double descent phenomenon from a new perspective. However, it does not provide much new insight for the phenomenon. The reasons are as follows:\n1. The object lying in the center of the analysis---the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the Gram matrix---is the well known cause of the double descent phenomenon in linear least squares problems (including the random feature models), and is also extensively studied. In the works focusing on minimal norm solutions or ridge regression solutions, the same quantity is also studied and identified to be the factor that leads to the DD phenomenon. \n2. The upper bound for the excess risk only considers the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the Gram matrix, which means it only controls the slowest component in the dynamics. Hence, the bound becomes tight only when the number of iterations, T, becomes large. Before this, the components corresponding to big eigenvalues dominate the dynamics and the DD phenomenon does not appear. This is showed by the empirical results in the paper. However, once T is sufficiently big such that the component of the smallest eigenvalue dominates the dynamics, the GD solution is already close to the minimal norm solution or the l2 regularized solutions studied in previous works. Therefore, the so-called \"the roll of optimization\" does not make much sense. Especially considering that the loss function is actually convex and any reasonable optimization algorithm will converge to a global minimum. \n3. For a linear least squares problem, the GD solutions and the corresponding population risk can be written down in close form. Hence, the reviewer does not see the necessity to derive the excess risk bounds via indirect approach such as (\\Delta, M)-admissible. Also, the (\\Delta, M)-admissible condition does not help extend the analysis to non-linear cases. \n\nSome other comments:\n1. Shown by numerical experiments on neural networks, it seems the peak of the generalization error happens when the width approximately equals the number of data. This is different that shown in Belkin et.al, in which the the generalization error peaks when the number of parameters = number of data * number of classes. Hence, this is like a different kind of \"double descent\". It is possible to provide more explanation on this phenomenon using the techniques employed in the paper?\n2. Some notations are confusing. For example, (a) the excess risk is denoted by E(w^*) while w^* is actually a fixed point. It is better to use E(A_S(W_0)) to highlight the dependence of the excess risk with the GD solution.  (b) the data us denoted by a capital X, which it is mentioned that vectors are denoted by boldface lower case letters. This causes confusion. ",
    "comment": "Thank you for your comments. We disagree however that our work does not provide new insights. The connection between DD and optimization, and the connection between the smallest positive eigenvalue and DD, have not been made explicit in any work we are aware of. Experimentally we see that the smallest positive eigenvalue correlates with performance for small $T$ as well (even if the bound might not be tight), and seems predictive of the phenomena. \n\nThe role of this work is not to show that DD happens, this result is known as we specify in the paper as well, but to provide an alternative tools for understanding it. \n\nConcerning the experiments and the size of the networks, Belkin et al. report the number of all the parameters in the network. We report the number of units in the penultimate layer. We will make this clearer in the paper. As stated in the general comments, we consider that the network is composed of a feature extractor and a linear predictor. This setting is the closest to our theoretical analysis. The theory predicts that the peak happens when the size of the inputs of the linear predictor matches the number of input data which is confirmed in our experiments. This corresponds to a much larger networks than the ones reported in Belkin's paper: With 1000 input points, we observe a peak for a single hidden layer of 1000 hidden units, which corresponds to 795,010. In Belkin's work, the peak is reported at 10,000, corresponding to the number of inputs times the number of classes.\n\nWe will improve the notation based on your comments. Thank you!",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments and detailed feedback. Below are our responses to the comments.\n\nR4: It would be extremely helpful to provide a very short, intuitive summary of the overall proposal and derivation\n\nWe will add a brief overview of the algorithm in section 3 before going into the mathematical details.  We agree that it should help readers get an overall picture of the algorithm and improve the readability of the paper.\n\nR4: The introduction mentions what MAP does (lines 41-42 of p. 2) , but not why. IIUC, it is so that we need fewer actual samples to estimate the gradients.\n\nAs correctly pointed out by the reviewer, the reason for using MAP estimate is to lower the variance of the update as justified by (4). The reason why it decreases variance can be explained by the law of total variance. Consider we are interested in estimating $ \\mathbb{E} [f(X, Y)]$, where $X$ and $Y$ are random variables. Both estimators $f(X, Y)$ and $\\mathbb{E} [f(X, Y)|Y]$ are unbiased estimators. By the law of total variance:\n$$\\text{Var}(f(X, Y)) = \\text{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[f(X, Y)|Y]) + \\mathbb{E}(\\text{Var} [f(X, Y)|Y]) \\geq \\text{Var} (\\mathbb{E}[f(X, Y)|Y]).$$ \nThus, the estimator $\\mathbb{E} [f(X, Y)|Y]$ has a lower variance than the estimator $f(X, Y)$. In our case, $X$ corresponds to $H$ (the hidden state), and $Y$ corresponds to $S, A$ (the state and action). This explains why the terms inside the outer expectation in R.H.S. of (4) has a lower variance than that of L.H.S. We will add this discussion in the appendix.\n\nR4: Also, when the introduction and abstract mention that the proposed approach is equivalent to backpropagation. IIUC, it should be \"backpropagation with the reparametrization trick\".\n\nSince backprop with reparameterization trick on a network of normally distributed hidden units is equivalent to backprop on a network of deterministic hidden units with independently and normally distributed noise added to hidden units, we did not explicitly differentiate the two algorithms in the introduction. We acknowledge that it is unclear to readers without this discussion, so we will clarify the equivalence to be \u201cbackprop with the reparameterization trick\u201d.\n\nR4: Eq 11 and Theorem 2 seem to assert that the method is equivalent to backprop with the reparametrization trick.\n\nFor a network with normally distributed hidden units, MAP propagation is equivalent to backprop with the reparameterization trick after minimizing the energy function. That is, if we run (8) repeatedly until all units\u2019 values converge, then at this set of units\u2019 values, REINFORCE will give the same update as backprop with the reparameterization trick. Thus, if we directly apply backprop with the reparameterization trick without running (8) before, the update will not be the same as MAP propagation (note that MAP propagation is REINFORCE after running (8) repeatedly).\n\nR4: For the regression part (p. 4, l. 146), I do not understand what information is \"lost\". The appendix seems to suggest a simple centering and normalization method to address this \"loss\". Again, this could be clarified.\n\nWhen converting a regression task to an RL task, the negative loss is used as the reward to the agent, and usually, it is the negative L2 distance between the target output and the network output. Consider the case that the agent's output is 5.5 and the target output is 6.5. The reward to the agent is thus -1.0. However, the agent does not know whether it should increase or decrease the output (if the target output is 4.5, then the reward is still -1.0). However, in the original regression task, the optimal output (6.5) will be known to the network, and it can learn to increase its output. Therefore, in the conversion, the optimal information is lost, which makes learning slower.\n",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments and detailed feedback. Below are our responses to the comments.\n\nR3: is the main novelty of this work compared to the cited works is the application of MAP propagation to RL as opposed to (un)supervised learning?\n\nYes, one of the main novelties of MAP propagation compared to [5] and [20] is its application on RL tasks instead of supervised learning or unsupervised learning tasks. MAP propagation does not assume that the correct output is known and only requires a scalar reward that evaluates the network\u2019s output. As a result, the learning rule of MAP propagation is substantially different to [5] and [20] despite the common use of MAP estimation in part of the algorithms. For example, MAP propagation does not require clamping any values of the units that is required in both [5] and [20].\n\nR3: Perhaps some restructuring and rewriting could make the paper more easily readable.\n\nWe will add a brief overview of the algorithm in section 3 before going into the mathematical details, as suggested by R4. This should help readers get an overall picture of the algorithm.\n\nR3: Please have a brief description of the multiplexer and scalar regression tasks to make the text self-sufficient.\n\nA detailed description of the multiplexer task can be found in Appendix D. We will elaborate more about the scalar regression task in the revised version of the paper.\n\nR3: Due to inner loop optimization for each layer, there is added computational complexity. Could you please also have a comparison of the computational complexity of this method vs backprop?\n\nWe will include the following discussion in the revised version of the paper: Denote $L$ as the number of layers in the network and $N$ as the number of steps in the energy minimization (the inner loop). MAP propagation requires $LN$ layer\u2019s updates during the energy minimization, while backprop requires $L$ layer\u2019s updates to compute the feedback signals (iterating from the top layers). Therefore, MAP propagation takes $N$ times more layer\u2019s updates than backprop. However, the $LN$ layer\u2019s updates in MAP propagation can be done in parallel for all layers, so the time complexity for a single step of MAP propagation is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}(LN)$ if the update is done in parallel. For backprop, parallel computation of feedback signals is not possible, so the time complexity for a single step of backprop is $\\mathcal{O}(L)$.\n\nR3: The appending L:82 mentions that a different learning rate was used for each layer. This will result in an increase in the number of hyper-parameters with layer size. How difficult was it to tune each of these separately?\n\nIt is not difficult to tune the different learning rates for each layer. We found that it is better for deeper layers to have a lower learning rate, and the optimal relationship between learning rates of different layers is very similar across tasks.

As far as I know the variance reduction approach used here is novel and the main contribution.\n\nQuality:\n\nThe approach appears technically sound (I did not check the appendix carefully) and the experimental results reasonable, although only on relatively simple tasks.\n\nThe approach introduce here is interesting, because any new learning rule is interesting. But its main claimed benefits are that is more biologically plausible (than backprop) due to the use of only local information and a global reward. For this reason, it seems that other somewhat biological plausible approaches should have also been included as baselines, such as feedback alignment [11-13].\n\nThis submission would also be strengthened by discussing how ``biologically plausible'' this learning method is.

Based on the experiment here, this approach appears of interest. The interest to the neuroscience community would depend on how biologically plausible this learning rule is when examined in more detail.\n\nMinor Issues:\n\n$H$ is referred to the as the ``value'' of a layer.

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments and detailed feedback. Below are our responses to the comments.\n\nR2: it seems that other somewhat biological plausible approaches should have also been included as baselines\n\nAs the aim of our experiments is to demonstrate the effectiveness of MAP propagation in reducing the variance of REINFORCE, we did not include other biologically plausible learning rules as baselines in the experiments. Also, since most biologically plausible learning rules proposed have a sub-optimal performance compared to backprop and the main goal of these approaches is usually biological plausibility instead of performance [11-13, 21-26], it may not be very insightful to compare the performance between them directly. This may also explain why most experiments in these papers are compared against backprop only.\n\nR2: this submission would also be strengthened by discussing how ``biologically plausible'' this learning method is\n\nWe refer the reviewer to Appendix F for a detailed discussion of the biological plausibility of MAP propagation, which discusses the possible neural mechanisms implementing equation (8). Though (8) is presented layer-wise, communication between units within the same layer is not required, as seen by (63). In other words, (8) and (63) can be performed unit-wise instead of layer-wise.\n\nR2: it would be helpful to be explicit about what the expectation is taken over\n\nWe agree that some equations with multiple expectations (like (4)) may be confusing to readers. We will explicitly state what the expectation is taken over in the revised version.\n\nOther response:\n\nWe will clarify H to be the activation value of a layer. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) is stated in L121, but we will repeat the full term in the introduction. \n",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the comments. The reviewer questions the motivation of proposing biologically plausible learning methods instead of learning methods that give a better empirical performance. This is a general question that involves the whole research field of biologically plausible machine learning (ML). Since the motivation of biologically plausible ML is a huge topic, we will be brief in the following discussion and refer the reviewer to [1] for a comprehensive review of the recent advances in biologically plausible ML and their significance in ML. \n\nFirst, although biologically plausible learning methods may not achieve state-of-the-art empirical performance in ML tasks, they often become the foundation for new state-of-the-art algorithms. An early example is Hopfield Networks [2], which were inspired by biological neural networks. Despite having a low memory capacity, Hopfield Networks led to Boltzmann Machines, Deep Belief Networks, and subsequently deep learning. Similarity, MAP propagation, as a biologically plausible alternative to backprop, may also lead to new state-of-the-art algorithms given the importance of backprop in deep learning. Second, biologically plausible learning methods often lead to advances in neuroscience and numerous examples are discussed in [1]. As pointed out by R3, MAP propagation may be of interest to the neuroscience community since it presents an alternative to backprop, which is generally regarded to be biologically implausible.\n\nOverall, although it is sound to question the motivation of biologically plausible learning rules in general, we do not agree that this is a sufficient reason to reject a paper. \n\n[1] Hassabis, Demis, et al. \"Neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence.\" Neuron 95.2 (2017): 245-258.\n\n[2] Hopfield, John J. \"Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities.\" Proceedings of the national academy of sciences 79.8 (1982): 2554-2558.",

    "review": "Although injecting structural features in the input of GNNs is common in the GNN community, usually, the theoretical justifications are limited in showing improvements over the 1-WL, while sometimes the structural features are chosen in an ad-hoc way. However, this paper goes much deeper in the theoretical justifications showing that homomorphisms allow a more accurate characterisation of expressivity, while most importantly, using the observation that different types of subgraph counting (motifs, graphlets, homomorphisms\u2026) can be derived from one another via linear combinations (e.g., see  Borgs et al., \u201cCounting Graph Homomorphisms\u201d Topics in Discrete Mathematics, 2006), they motivate why homomorphisms can be an elegant and unifying framework.\n\nI must admit that it is a bit hard to follow for non-experts due to the utilisation of many specialised notions in graph theory, so there is room for improvement in that respect. Specific comments follow:\n\n**Strengths**:\n\n- I found this paper quite useful to the community, bringing important ideas from graph theory to graph neural networks, and shedding light on many open questions in the expressive power of this class of GNNs. I also appreciate the fact that the authors are honest w.r.t. the main limitation of the work, i.e. the pattern selection.\n- The paper addresses a number of open research questions described in GSNs (although not directly applicable to GSNs, the corresponding results on $\\mathcal{F}$-MPNNs provide important insights to the reader):  \n     - How do substructure-enabled MPNNs relate to k-WL (Proposition 2 and 3)?\n     - What type of patterns grant F-MPNNs the ability to distinguish graphs that k-WL cannot (cores of treewidth k \u2013 Theorem 2; this is in agreement with the 4-clique counterexample used in the GSN paper)? \n     - In which cases can we be sure that expressivity increases when adding patterns to the collection (Propositions 4,5 and Theorem 3)? Moreover, Proposition 5 implies a compositionality property of certain patterns, i.e., when two patterns $P_1$, $P_2$ are added to the collection, expressivity increases more than by simply adding their composition $P_{1,2}$. I am still not sure though if this implies that a $\\\\{P_1, P_2\\\\}$-MPNN can count $P_{1,2}$ homomorphisms.\n-\tThe experimental results are diverse, spanning all types of graph-related problems, showing consistent improvement against the conventional MPNN baselines.\n\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n-\tIn my opinion, the paper is a bit hard to follow. Although this is expected when discussing more involved concepts, I think it would be beneficial for the exposition of the manuscript and in order to reach a larger audience, to try to make it more didactic. Some suggestions: \n    -\tA visualization showing a counting of homomorphisms vs subgraph isomorphism counting.\n    - It might be a good idea to include a formal or intuitive definition of the treewidth since it is central to all the proofs in the paper.\n    - The authors define rooted patterns (in a similar way to the orbit counting in GSN), but do not elaborate on why it is important for the patterns to be rooted, neither how they choose the roots. A brief discussion is expected, or if non-rooted patterns are sufficient, it might be better for the sake of exposition to discuss this case only in the supplementary material.\n-\tThe authors do not adequately discuss the computational complexity of counting homomorphisms. They make brief statements (e.g., L 145 \u201cBetter still, homomorphism counts of small graph patterns can be efficiently computed even on large datasets\u201d), but I think it will be beneficial for the paper to explicitly add the upper bounds of counting and potentially elaborate on empirical runtimes.\n-\tComparison with GSN: The authors mention in section 2 that F-MPNNs are a unifying framework that includes GSNs. In my perspective, given that GSN is a quite similar framework to this work, this is an important claim that should be more formally stated. In particular, as shown by Curticapean et al., 2017, in order to obtain isomorphism counts of a pattern P, one needs not only to compute P-homomorphisms, but also those of the graphs that arise when doing \u201cnon-edge contractions\u201d (the spasm of P). Hence a spasm(P)-MPNN would require one extra layer to simulate a P-GSN. I think formally stating this will give the interested reader intuition on the expressive power of GSNs, albeit not an exact characterisation (we can only say that P-GSN is at most as powerful as a spasm(P)-MPNN but we cannot exactly characterise it; is that correct?)\n-\tAlso, since the concept of homomorphisms is not entirely new in graph ML, a more elaborate comparison with the paper by NT and Maehara, \u201cGraph Homomorphism Convolution\u201d, ICML\u201920 would be beneficial. This paper can be perceived as the kernel analogue to F-MPNNs. Moreover, in this paper, a universality result is provided, which might turn out to be beneficial for the authors as well.\n\n\n\n**Additional comments**:\n- I think that something is missing from Proposition 3. In particular, if I understood correctly the proof is based on the fact that we can always construct a counterexample such that F-MPNNs will not be equally strong to 2-WL (which by the way is a stronger claim). However, if the graphs are of bounded size, a counterexample is not guaranteed to exist (this would imply that the reconstruction conjecture is false). Maybe it would help to mention in Proposition 3 that graphs are of unbounded size?  \n-\tMoreover, there is a detail in the proof of Proposition 3 that I am not sure that it\u2019s that obvious. I understand why the subgraph counts of $C_{m+1}$ are unequal between the two compared graphs, but I am not sure why this is also true for homomorphism counts.\n-\tTheorem 3: The definition of the core of a graph is unclear to me (e.g., what if P contains cliques of multiple sizes?)\n-\tIn the appendix, the authors mention they used 16 layers for their dataset. That is an unusually large number of layers for GNNs. Could the authors comment on this choice?\n-\tIn the same context as above, the experiments on the ZINC benchmark are usually performed with either ~100K or 500K parameters. Although I doubt that changing the number of parameters will lead to a dramatic change in performance, I suggest that the authors repeat their experiments, simply for consistency with the baselines.\n-\tThe method of Bouritsas et al., arxiv\u201920 is called \u201cGraph Substructure Networks\u201d (instead of \u201cStructure\u201d). I encourage the authors to correct this.\n\n-------\n-------\n### After rebuttal\n\nThe authors have adequately addressed all my concerns. Enhancing MPNNs with structural features is a family of well-performing techniques that have recently gained traction. This paper introduces a unifying framework, in the context of which many open theoretical questions can be answered, hence significantly improving our understanding. Therefore, I will keep my initial recommendation and vote for acceptance. Please see my comment below for my final suggestions which, along with some improvements on the presentation, I hope will increase the impact of the paper.\n",
    "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for his detailed and positive feedback.\n\n**Presentation.**\nThe reviewer makes a couple of suggestions to explain certain complex concepts in a more didactic way. We thank the reviewer for these suggestions, which we will take on board when preparing the final version. The reviewer also would like to see a brief discussion related to the use of  rooted patterns. The root in the pattern tells how we want to embed the pattern locally around vertices in the data graph. We note that for symmetric patterns such as cliques or cycles, which we use in the experiments, the choice of root vertex is irrelevant. For asymmetric patterns, or unrooted patterns, we recommend, similarly as done in GSNs, to use copies of the pattern with different roots (one copy for each different vertex orbit in the pattern). Alternatively, one could use an unrooted pattern but then only count those homomorphisms whose image contains the vertex in the data graph. We do not know for certain how this model compares to the rooted one, but we speculate it is less expressive, as we are always aggregating together all rooted versions of the patterns. A discussion related to rooted versus unrooted patterns will be included in the final paper. Finally, we fix \"Graph Structure Networks\" to \"Graph Substructure Networks\", thanks for pointing this out.\n\n**On the comparison with GSNs.**\nThe reviewer correctly observes that $\\mathcal P$-GSNs are bounded by $\\mathsf{spasm}(\\mathcal P)$-MPNNs, as we also explain in the supplementary material. We will put this claim as a formal statement in the main paper, as suggested by the reviewer. As a side note, we can obtain a precise characterization of GSNs in our framework if we specialize the notion of homomorphisms/isomorphism of $\\mathcal P$-trees so that they embed the backbone of a $\\mathcal P$-tree homomorphically, but the $\\mathcal P$-patterns in the leaves of the tree to isomorphic subgraphs. For clarity of exposition, we decided to stick to the standard notion of homomorphisms, at the expense of moving from $\\mathcal P$ to $\\mathsf{spasm}(\\mathcal P)$ in the comparison between GSNs and $\\mathcal F$-MPNNs\n\n**On the use of homomorphisms.**\nThe reviewer would like to see a theoretical comparison between the use of homomorphism counts in $\\mathcal F$-MPNNs and and in the Graph Homomorphism Convolutions (GHCs) by NT and Maehara, cited in the paper. There are indeed interesting connections: Whereas the GHCs use only homomorphism counts of patterns in $\\mathcal F$ (followed by the use of an SVM), $\\mathcal F$-MPNNs expand the set $\\mathcal F$ of patterns to $\\mathcal F$-pattern trees (Theorem 1 in our paper). We provide an example in the supplementary material of two graphs, sharing the same homomorphism counts for a set $\\mathcal F$ of patterns, but having different homomorphism counts for $\\mathcal F$-pattern trees of depth $>1$. In combination with the techniques by NT and Maehara, one could therefore possibly learn functions beyond those that are $\\mathcal F$-invariant. We will elaborate on this interesting connection in the final paper.\n\n**On the complexity of counting homomorphisms.**\nThe reviewer suggest to include theoretical upper bound for counting homomorphisms, as suggestion also made by reviewer #1. The worst case complexity of computing $\\mathsf{hom}(P,G)$ is $\\mathcal O(n^k)$ where $n$ is the size of $G$ and $k$ is the size of $P$. Better upper bounds can be obtained when a tree-decomposition of the pattern $P$ is provided. Despite the exponential dependency on $k$, the system that we use to compute our additional features  (DISC, Zhang et al. 2020) leverages state-of-the-art distributed join processing algorithms and in this way, makes counting homomorphisms feasible for small patterns and large scale datasets. And indeed, on our selected datasets, this cost was negligible compared to the cost incurred by learning the parameters. For Collab, a dataset consisting of one large graph of 236k nodes and 2358k edges, the counting of 3,4 and 5-cliques homomorphisms for all nodes took 13s , 8s and 34s respectively. Other datasets were large collections of small graphs and homomorphism counts can be obtained at the time of loading the graphs.\n\n**Clarifications related to the statement of Proposition 3.**\nThe reviewer requires some additional explanation related to the statement of Proposition 3.\nTo avoid any confusion, we will clarify that the proof of Proposition 3 provides counterexample graphs of sizes that are dependent on the sizes of patterns in $\\mathcal F$. We note, however, that the statement of Proposition 3 is correct. It states that, for any $k>1$, there does not exist a finite set $\\mathcal F$ of patterns such that $\\mathcal F$-WL is equivalent in expressive power to $k$-WL. To show this, it suffices to exhibit, for any $k>1$ and finite set $\\mathcal F$ of patterns, two graphs $G$ and $H$, such that $k$-WL can distinguish them, whereas $\\mathcal F$-WL cannot.\nWe remark that no restriction on the sizes of  $G$ and $H$ are implied (or required).\nFurthermore, we will clarify that it suffices to show the Proposition for $k=2$, as observed by the reviewer, since this is how Proposition 3 is proved in the supplementary material.\n\nThe reviewer further asks for some clarifications on the proof of Proposition 3. We thank the reviewer for checking the proofs in the supplementary material. We will add the following clarification to the supplementary material.\nRecall from the proof that $G$ consists of $m+2$ disjoint copies of $C_{m+1}$ and $H$ consists of $m+1$ copies of $C_{m+2}$. \nConsider $\\mathsf{hom}(C_{m+1},G)$ and $\\mathsf{hom}(C_{m+1},H)$. \nWe can write these as \n$(m+2)(m+1)\\mathsf{hom}(C_{m+1}^r,C_{m+1}^v)$ and $(m+1)(m+2)\\mathsf{hom}(C_{m+1}^r,C_{m+2}^w)$  for some fixed vertices $v$ and $w$ and where all cycles are now rooted.\nIt now suffices to observe that all homomorphisms $h$ from $C_{m+1}^r$ to $C_{m+2}^w$ are such that the image $h(C_{m+1}^r)$ contain $< m+1$ vertices. And moreover, with any such $h$, we can associate a unique $h\u2019$ from $C_{m+1}^r$ to $C_{m+1}^v$ (such that also $h\u2019(C_{m+1}^r)$ contains $<m+1$ vertices). Finally, we note that there are two homomorphisms from $C_{m+1}^r$ to $C_{m+1}^v$ which are surjections and thus cover all $m+1$ vertices in $C_{m+1}^v$.  We may thus conclude that $\\mathsf{hom}(C_{m+1}^r,C_{m+2}^w) < \\mathsf{hom}(C_{m+1}^r,C_{m+1}^v)$, from which we can infer that $\\mathsf{hom}(C_{m+1},G)\\neq \\mathsf{hom}(C_{m+1},H)$, as desired.\n\n**Definition of core of a graph.**\nThe reviewer asks for a clarification of the definition of a core of a graph. Many thanks for pointing this out: Our current definition is wrong as we forgot to add an important condition, i.e., that the core of $P$ must be a homomorphic image of $P$ (in addition to simply being a core of itself). This is precisely what causes the reviewer's confusion regarding the case when $P$ is the union of two cliques, say $P = K_3 + K_4$. The core of $P$ is $K_4$, as there is a homomorphic image from $P$ into it and $K_4$ is itself a core. In turn, $K_3$ is not a core of $P$ as there is no homomorphism from $P$ into $K_3$. We will fix this of course.  \n\n**Experiments**\nThe reviewers asks for a comment on the use of 16 layers and parameter budgets used in some of the experiments. Our experiments are based on the benchmarking initiative by Dwivedi et al. For the ZINC and PATTERN datasets, the performance of GNNs with ~100k parameters and ~500k parameters is reported by Dwivedi et al, which correspond respectively to 4 and 16 message passing layers. As the latter showed a stronger performance in all cases we focused on augmenting these larger models with the additional features as it was our intention to compare against the strongest baseline for these benchmarks. To have a full comparison we will repeat our experiments by setting the number of message passing layers to 4 and corresponding ~100k parameter budget. A baseline with the same parameters and 4 layers will also be included in the final paper.\nWe also would like to emphasize that we trained the baseline models ourselves instead of just reporting the numbers of Dwivedi et al.

    "review": "Pro:\n- It is a smart idea to utilize the design of the F-WL-test to design the F-MPNN, so that this type of GNN can enjoy the theoretical guarantee of distinguishing power as what the F-WL-test has.\n- This method is less expensive than some higher-order MPNN in terms of the complexity in each iteration.\n\nCons:\n- The proofs heavily depend on existing works but are not suitably mentioned in the main text. I think it is totally fine to make a statement in the main text because a novel combination of existing proof techniques is also valuable.\n- As already mentioned by the authors, in practice it is hard to pre-select a suitable set of patterns since they cannot be learned by gradients. The theoretical results in Sec 4 do provide certain information but they are not enough to serve as practical guidance since the search space is just way too large.\n- Experiments can be conducted more rigorously (see below).\n\nDetailed questions for experiments:\n- By adding the patterns, the dimension of the augmented node features will become larger and the model will contain more parameters. When making the comparison, have all models used the same feature dimension and the same number of parameters? This should be controlled to exclude the effect of using a larger model. (e.g., the results in Table 1 (b))\n- The key baseline in this paper is the ISO in Table 1 (a). Why results of ISO are missing in Table 2 and Table 3? If one also searches the best performing pattern for ISO using the same computing cost as the search for F-MPNN, what will be the best performing accuracy for ISO on PATTERN and COLLAB?\n- Except for ISO, there are several other works that also augment the initial feature with precomputed node features. Some simple ones include random feature [1], port numbering / weak-coloring feature [2], local matrix feature [3]. I noticed that these three are also cited in related work. It will be better to see a comparison to these simple augmented approaches.\n- Minor question: The hyperparameters of the GNNs are not described. What's the hidden size? Number of hops? Will different choices of these hyperparameters affect the improvement from augmenting the features?\n\nOther question:\n- Although it is a one-time preprocessing stage, how is the complexity?\n\nSummary:\n- This paper provides theoretical guarantees for the proposed F-MPNN in its distinguishing power, which is valuable. However, since the theory is insufficient to provide practical guidance for choosing a suitable set of F patterns, I think the empirical experiments become important to support the claims in this paper. Therefore, my main concern is that the experiments are not convincing enough (see details above).\n\n[1] Sato,  R.,  Yamada,  M.,  and  Kashima,  H.

I appreciate the theoretical contribution of this paper, but I still have concerns about its practical usage, without the experimental comparison to other augmented GNN models. The authors claimed that this method can extend any existing GNNs, including those augmented GNNs. However, although the paper has theoretically shown the improvement in expressiveness compared to MPNN, the improvement to existing *augmented* MPNNs [1,2,3] are unclear, which will require additional experiments to verify. Moreover, these augmented GNNs [1,2,3] and some other alternatives that use distance-based features are less expensive (pre-processing) and do not require choosing the patterns (that means fewer tuning parameters). How useful is the proposed method compared to these **simpler** methods (which also have theoretical guarantees) is unclear. This is the major reason why I choose to retain my initial score. I personally believe this will be a very nice paper if additional experiments with convincing results are provided.\n",
    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback.\n\n**On the presentation of proof techniques.** \nWe appreciate that the reviewer recognizes that our proof techniques considerably extend and combine existing techniques in a novel way. We do cite all the relevant papers, in which the techniques used can be found, alongside our results in the main paper, and hint how we extend and combine the techniques. We are brief, mainly due to space limitations, and pushed many details to the supplementary material. The reviewer would find it valuable to have more details in the main paper. We will provide more details in the final paper as these are indeed part of our main contributions.\n\n**On the selection of patterns.**\nThe reviewer correctly points out that in practice a suitable set of patterns needs to be selected, either by experts based on domain knowledge, or by suitable feature engineering. However, we think our paper and in particular the results in Section 4 in the paper, do provide practical guidance: it is a good idea to start by selecting small patterns that we know (by Proposition 4 and Theorem 3) cannot be distinguished by standard MPNNs, such as triangles, 4-cliques or 4-cycles. This guidance comes from theory (Proposition 5 tells us that by adding such patterns, more complex graph structures obtained by combining the simple patterns are captured as well), and also by experiments: all datasets seem to gain some benefit when incorporating those simple patterns. Notice also that Proposition 5 also helps us reduce the search space by a great extent: For example, once we add triangles, we no longer need to search for any pattern that incorporates a triangle at the root. \nFinally, we also want to stress that our experiments provide preliminary evidence that we don\u2019t really need to look for *the* most informative pattern in the dataset, just adding standard patterns already provides a considerable boost in the learning power. \nWe agree, however, that questions related to pattern selection open up very interesting pathways for future work, as we mention also in our Conclusion section.\n\n**On the complexity of counting homomorphisms.**\nThe reviewer asks for the complexity of counting homomorphisms, a request also made by reviewer #3. The worst case complexity of computing $\\mathsf{hom}(P,G)$ is $\\mathcal O(n^k)$ where $n$ is the size of $G$ and $k$ is the size of $P$. Better upper bounds can be obtained when a tree-decomposition of the pattern $P$ is provided. Despite the exponential dependency on $k$, the homomorphism counting problem is the most common task in databases, and in particular graph databases, and there is a broad range of literature, algorithms and systems capable of performing homomorphism counts in very reasonable times. Indeed, the system that we use to compute our additional features  (DISC, Zhang et al. 2020) leverages state-of-the-art distributed graph join processing algorithms and in this way, makes counting homomorphisms feasible for small patterns and large scale datasets. On our selected datasets, this cost was negligible compared to the cost incurred by learning the parameters, as mentioned in the paper. We emphasize that if one would use higher-order GNNs, which may be able to detect complex graph patterns, each of their layers requires $\\mathcal O(n^k)$ complexity, because they operate on $k$-dimensional tensors. In our setting, we pay the $\\mathcal O(n^k)$ price only once and can leverage efficient state-of-the-art implementations. \n\n**Experiments.** \n\n__*On the feature dimensions.*__  The reviewer asks for the differences in sizes of the models, when augmented with additional features. For a given model, *only* the  feature dimension (and consequently the number of parameters) in the first layer vary. This is needed in order to accommodate for the varying number of homomorphism count parameters (that is, our additional features). For all other layers, feature dimensions and the number of parameters in any message-passing and readout layers are identical for a given model, independent of whether or not the initial layer contains additional homomorphism count parameters. \n\nWe emphasize, however, that the additional number of parameters in the first layer is only a very small fraction of the total number of parameters, as reported in Tables 5, 8, 11 and 14 in the supplementary material. For example, for Table 1(b), reporting the GAT architecture on the ZINC dataset, the baseline (no additional features) has a total of 358273 parameters, the model with all cycles up to length 10, has only 1152 extra parameters. The differences are smaller for the other architectures. For example, the GatedGCN model has 408135 parameters for the baseline and 408695 for the model with all cycle counts, a difference of 560 additional parameters.\n\nFurthermore, for MPNNs, the number of parameters in the first layer is directly related to the number of features used. So, say that the baseline contains $f$ features, and one of the other models uses $f+g$ features ($g$ being the number of homomorphism counts added). Then, to obtain the same number of parameters, we need to add $g$ features to the baseline as well. It is unclear to us what precisely these $g$ additional features should be.\nWe also note that the additional homomorphism count features cannot be learned from the baseline, even if we augment these with arbitrarily many dummy (constant, copies of existing) features. This is due to the limited power of MPNNs.\n\n__*Missing ISO counts for PATTERN and COLLAB.*__  We thank the reviewer for this comment. The reason that subgraph isomorphisms counts (ISO) are not explicitly mentioned for PATTERN and COLLAB is because for these datasets the additional features are homomorphism counts (HOM) of small cliques. For cliques, HOM and ISO on any graph only differ by a linear factor (the number of automorphisms of the clique). This means that, after normalization, there is no difference in adding HOM or ISO counts of cliques as features. For this reason, ISO is excluded. We do mention this in Section 6 \u201cWe remark that for cliques, homomorphism counts coincide with subgraph isomorphism counts (up to a constant factor)\u201d, but will emphasize this even more in the final paper.\n\n__*Parameters of GNNs.*__ The reviewer asks for details about the models used. We use the parameters as used in the publicly available benchmark implementation by Dwivedi et al. and therefore only state hyperparameters for every graph task in the experimental section of the supplementary material (Section E.2). For the number of layers, following the best performing benchmarks for every model we use 16 layers for ZINC and PATTERN and 3 layers for COLLAB. The size of the hidden features vary depending on the selected GNN model. This variation comes from the fact that the comparison of different GNNs in the benchmark is done with a similar parameter budget for all models. We will include the hidden feature sizes in section E.2. in the supplementary material, but provide the table for hidden feature dimensions below, for the reviewer's convenience. \nWe remark that we did not perform any hyperparameter tuning, as our focus was to identify the effect of the additional features and select features from the set of small cycles or cliques rather than finding the optimal choice of hyperparameters for a given graph task.\n\nHidden feature dimension table:\n\n|           | ZINC | COLLAB | PATTERN |\n|-----------|------|--------|---------|\n| GAT       | 144  |   57   | 136     |\n| GCN       |  145 | 74 | 146   |\n| GraphSage |    108 | 38 | 108  |\n| MoNet     |   90 | 53 | 90  |\n| GatedGCN  |    70 | 35| 70    |\n\n__*Additional comparisons.*__ The reviewer suggests including comparisons with three approaches that are cited in our paper. We would like to emphasise that our goal is not to compare directly to other approaches, but instead investigate how much existing methods can benefit from adding our extended features (homomorphism counts of patterns). Indeed, we believe that one of the important aspects of our proposal is that it provides a generic plug-in that can be used for any method, including the ones mentioned by the reviewer. This is why we chose to use the benchmark initiative by Dwivedi et al. in our experiments, as it gave us a common starting ground to report the improvement on several MPNN architectures. Regarding a more in-depth comparison with other approaches such as [1], [2] or [3]: we can obtain an approximate comparison by looking at other approaches that have used the same datasets in their experiments (such as [3], which tests on the ZINC dataset). In this approximate comparison, we also observe that the models in the benchmark become competitive to the state of the art when augmented with homomorphism counts. However, we prefer not to put this numbers in the paper because it takes us away from our original goal of investigating how much existing methods can benefit from adding our extended features. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "review": "The paper positions its main contribution in a general framework for computationally efficient interactive learning, while making a strong assumption that the data are realizable. \n\nIt is okay to confine to realizable setting but I am not convinced of the motivating example. The starting point is that for learning of threshold over a bounded interval, agnostic learner is inferior to realizable learner; thus authors decide to stick with the latter. I agree this example is true but it turns out that such motivation is superficial and seems diminish tremendous efforts in agnostic learning in the past decades. Furthermore, the nice query complexity shown in the example seems just a singular case; same result does not hold for more general and practical setup such as halfspace in $R^d$. \n\nI also found the presentation is confusing.

What you can really do is to compare Theorem 4 to [11]. However, in this case, the above issue persists so there is no evidence that your algorithm outperforms.\n\nMy overall feeling is that the paper is too dense to follow, and the major technical contribution is vague. While it is interesting to see results for general loss functions, it leads an unknown quantity (i.e. sampling probability) in sample complexity so the bound is of little interest.\n\n## updates after author rebuttal\n\nAuthors addressed most of my concerns.

    "comment": "Thank you for your review. We appreciate your careful reading of our work. In the next version of this paper, we will work to make the paper less dense via more explanatory examples, a clearer statement of its technical contributions, and providing more intuition on mathematical statements. Please see responses at the top for worked out examples of computational and sample complexity bounds and a discussion of the sampling probability of $f^\\ast$. \n\nRegarding past work on agnostic active learning: we agree that agnostic active learning is a very important and practically relevant area. The core importance of our Propositions 1-3 is to show however that agnostic learning is not minimax optimal in the realizable setting. \n\n\nRegarding \"no free lunch'' for other classes of functions: the gap between realizable and agnostic algorithms can in fact be shown to exist even for homogeneous linear separators since one can embed the simple instance from Proposition 1 into the homogeneous linear separator setting. Consider points forming an $\\epsilon$-cover of the union of the Euclidean unit ball $B_1$ centered at $0$ and a second ball, $B_2$, disjoint from $B_1$. There exists a realizability-based algorithm that identifies the optimal homogeneous linear separator in $O(d\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ queries whereas using our lower bound techniques it can be shown that an agnostic approach necessarily requires $\\Omega(d\\cdot \\text{Poly}(1/\\epsilon))$ queries. We also note that the instance in Proposition 1 is not unique to combinatorial settings and, in fact, was inspired by an example constructed for linear separators in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ in [17]. \n\n\n\n\nRegarding the result of [11]: we wish to stress that the result of [11] is in fact not computationally efficient since it assumes that one can enumerate the function class which is intractable even for linear classes. One of our main contributions is building the first computationally efficient algorithm that is nearly minimax optimal and solves the problem stated in [11].\n\nRegarding a comparison between [11] and Theorem 5: since the algorithm of [11] and our Algorithm 3 from Theorem 5 are both computationally infeasible, this is a fair comparison between algorithms with similar computational costs. Part of the confusion may be due to a typo we found in the statement of Theorem 5. It should be referring to Algorithm 3 as opposed to Algorithm 2. We apologize for the mistake. \n\n\nRegarding results for active classification presented in our paper: please see the comment to all reviewers about the problem settings and contributions of our paper. This paper develops a general technique for efficient interactive learning. Active classification is one example setting we consider alongside best arm identification, loss minimization, $\\epsilon$-good identification, and thresholding. Due to space constraints, it was placed in the appendix, but if there is room for it, we agree that it would be good to include in the main body. \n",

    "review": "Active learning is the classic approach for reducing label complexity during model learning. Years ago, many empirical experiments showed little improvement over random sampling which led to the suspicion that active learning doesn't work. It has since been demonstrated that active learning algorithms do exist which learn at an exponential rate [see the work of Balcan et al.]. This paper continues that line of work, showing that realizability is a key ingredient in active learning. \n\nOverall the paper is well structured, but notation dense. It would be easier to read if more equations were followed with \"in words\" or (approximate) conceptual descriptions. Also, previews such as \"now we prove such and a such result, the approach is to do this and that\" would increase readability.

    "submission_title": "Practical, Provably-Correct Interactive Learning in the Realizable Setting: The Power of True Believers",
    "review": "Interactive learning (in the sense discussed in this paper) consists of gradually querying a set of points $x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n$ so as to obtain information about associated rewards/losses $y_1,\\dots,y_n$. Different problems correspond to different goals to be reached with the queries. So-called best-arm identification consists of querying some $x_i$ with smallest possible loss in the least amount of time. A similar problem (apparently introduced here) is to minimize the losses of queried points up to the point where a best arm is found. Finally, in active learning the rewards/losses are binary labels, and the goal is to learn the function $f$ from a given class that best approximates the labels. \n\nThis paper consider the realizable setting where the rewards satisfy $y_i=f(x_i)$ for an unknown function $f$ belonging to a known family $\\mathcal{F}$ (the case where the $y_i$ may be noisy is considered in the Appendix). For best arm identification, reference [11] gives a nearly tight query complexity bound (without an efficient algorithm). One of the positive results of the present paper is an algorithm that is efficient under certain somewhat awkward assumptions: namely, that $\\mathcal{F}$ is a family consisting of discretizations of functions that belong to a convex set $\\mathcal{R}$. Cumulative loss minimization is dealt with similarly. Similarly, active learning is relegated to an appendix.\n\nOne drawback of the above algorithms is that they require the realizability assumption. The paper also shows that this is in some way unavoidable (this is the content of Propositions 1 through 3). \n\nAs far as I can tell, this is a correct and nontrivial contribution with some interest. The main technical idea is replacing the ```````\"version space\" (where functions compatible with the data are considered) with a convex set. To understand it, first note that a natural version for query complexity problems is to keep a version space containing all functions $f$ compatible with the results that were seen. The gist of the authors approach is to replace this version space with a convex set in function space that consists of an intersection of polynomially many semispaces with the function class $\\mathcal{F}$. Using sampling methods for these convex sets, this strategy can be made to work, and one may show that the sets quickly shrink until only one candidate function is left. This works under the assumption that $\\mathcal{Y}$ is finite: for infinite sets, a different approach must be used, with less precise bounds. \n\nThe results of this paper seem novel and important enough to warrant publication at NeurIPS. In particular, the problems posed here address natural open questions raised in [11] (from 2011), as well as some new problems. The lower bounds are also interesting, and experimental results against Bayesian optimization methods seem promising.\n\nHowever, the exposition leaves a lot to be desired. I will itemize some issues in what follows. Do note that I have not written down typos, but there are many of them! \n\n* The authors are a bit too cavalier when they imply that sampling in convex bodies is always \"efficient\". There are subtleties involved, such as the need for membership oracles and the like. Some of those issues should be discussed in the appendix. \n* In particular, it would be nice to understand the complexity for at least one of the problems under consideration. \n* Similarly, actual query complexity bounds are never fully worked out for the algorithm Grails. It'd be nice to understand the query complexity of the proposed methods in some of the examples considered in the appendix.\n* To sum up the above suggestions, it would be nice to see a full result for some simple case of the problems considered in the paper (eg. active classification with linear functions). In this example, all relevant parameters and the complexity upper bound should be worked out. \n* In section 2, the authors mention the realizable setting, and then define Active Classification without explaining what it looks like in the realizable setting. \n* The assumption that $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathcal{R}}$ is obtained from $\\mathcal{R}$ by discretization does not seem very natural and is hard to swallow. The one case where it makes a lot of sense is that of active classification, because $\\mathcal{Y}=\\{1,-1\\}$ in that case. Unfortunately, that case is relegated to the appendix. Somewhat awkwardly, a lower bound for Active Classification is given in the main text.\n* $\\S$ 5.1: this is a minor technicality, but some of the halfspaces considered in the text are open.\n\n",
    "comment": "Thank you very much for your thorough review of our work. We will work to make the exposition clearer and fix the typos. Note that some of your comments are addressed in the response at the top.\n\nRegarding computational efficiency: we will clarify the subtleties of sampling from a convex body such as the need for a membership oracle and to emphasize this point, we will give an example of a convex body where no such membership is available (e.g., a polyhedron defined by exponentially many constraints). We will move our discussion about efficient implementation to the main body to further clarify these subtleties. Thank you for this comment. \n\nRegarding the discretized setting: while it is often natural to have a discretized output setting (e.g., 1-5 star ratings by humans), we acknowledge that removing discretization is an interesting avenue for future research.\n\n\nRegarding the open halfspaces: Thank you for catching this. We will fix this typo in the final version. \n\n\nPlease see the response at the top for a discussion regarding your comments on computational efficiency and sample complexity.",

    "comment": "**(Q1) Query, Key, and Value selection**\n\n**(A1)**\nIn order to define why we choose the speech representation as query and the global visual representations as the key and value, the motivation for introducing the VCA module should be delivered in advance. The main challenge in generating speech from a silent lip video is the existence of homophenes that have similar lip movement while acoustic pronunciations are different. For example, \u2018mark\u2019, \u2018bark\u2019, and \u2018park\u2019 have the same lip movements while the speech sounds are distinct. In order to capture the differences and generating accurate speech from the silent lip video, the context should be considered. Therefore, we built a VCA module that can capture the global context from the entire sequences of input lip video. For providing the global visual context into the generation procedure and refining the coarsely generated speech, we designed the query by using the generated speech features, and key and value by using the visual representations. Thus, the global visual context can be considered for the further speech generation parts.\n\n---\n\n**(Q2) Number of generators (discriminators)**\n\n**(A2)**\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. In order to show how the number of generators (discriminators) affects the whole performance, we report the speech quality metric performances under the different number of generators (discriminators) shown in Table R4_1.\n\n- **Table R4_1** Speech quality scores of different $n$\n| $n$ | STOI | ESTOI | PESQ |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| 1 | 0.733 | 0.601 | 1.935 |\n| 2 | 0.732 | 0.595 | 1.948 |\n| 3 | 0.736 | 0.604 | 1.961 | \n\nBy increasing the number of generators (discriminators), the PESQ scores are improved and this result shows that using multi-scale generation is beneficial to synthesize the speech clearer. Therefore, we choose $n$=3 by considering both the performance and model parameters (we did not try more than 3 due to memory constraints).\n\n---\n\n**(Q3) Why AV attention helps to generate audio**\n\n**(A3)**\nAs we have mentioned, the Audio-Visual (AV) attention is constructed to consider the global visual context in the VCA module. In the following, we describe how the AV attention mechanism can help the detailed audio generation. The coarsely generated audio representation at the first generator does not contain any global context since they are synthesized from the local visual representations. Therefore, the coarsely generated speech might not distinguish the homophenes. Through the AV attention, the most suitable global visual representation to the given coarsely generated audio can be searched. The searched global visual representation is obtained as a value in the AV attention and is concatenated with the coarsely generated audio representation. Then, the next generator refines the previous ambiguous speech more elaborately by jointly modelling the global and local representations. Please see Table 1 showing the VCA module improves the performance with the largest margin with the aforementioned role.\n\n---\n\n**(Q4) Audio-visual recognition models on generated voice**\n\n**(A4)**\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. As the reviewer pointed out, speech recognition using generated speech can be a helpful evaluation metrics to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Therefore, we applied a pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to the generated speech for measuring intelligibility. The measured WER performance using ASR is reported in Table 2, Table 5, and Table 6. Moreover, we additionally report the WER performance for the ablation study in Table R4_2. Please note that our method is for synthesizing the speech from silent video and thus we used ASR model instead of Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) model to measure the intelligibility of the synthesized speech.\n\n- **Table R4_2** WER performances on multi-speaker setting on GRID (will be added in Table1)  \n| Baseline | + Visual context attention | + Synchronization | + Multi-discriminators |  \n|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|  \n| 5.434% | 5.015% | 4.908% | 4.797% |  \n\n---\n\n**(Q5) About results shown in demo**\n\n**(A5)**\nWe would like to clarify the performance comparisons shown in the demo. First, the 1D GAN-based method [R10] shows speech with a rather noisy background, the Lip2Wav [R4] has some faults in speaking correct words, and the Vocoder-based method [R12] shows a rather unnatural voice (robotic). Please see the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) comparison results shown in Table 4 which performed with more generated samples.\n\n---\n\n[R#] represents reference # in the manuscript.\n",

    "review": "\nThis is a very well written paper (although it does have a number of minor typographical and grammatical errors; few are listed below) which is generally well motivated and easy to follow. The experimental section, in particular, is comprehensive and demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms previous works with larger gains in unseen and multi-speaker settings (which are more challenging to begin with). \n\nI had a few minor comments which if resolved would strengthen the paper further.\n\n- **Ablation results in Table 1 and Table 3**: It would be good to include WER numbers as well for the ablation study in Table 1 and the results in Table 3 to show fidelity in addition to intelligibility and quality, since it is also useful to see how well the reconstructed speech matches the ground-truth audio.\n\n- **Captured global context**: A point that is made in the paper, and in Table 1, is that the use of the global context helps resolve ambiguities. It would be interesting to present the results of some error analysis to show how the global context helps improve performance (WER results in Table 1, would help clarify this somewhat as well).\n\n- **Length of test videos**: In Section 4.2, the authors mention that during training the videos are segmented to smaller chunks, but during inference the authors evaluate the full videos. I was curious if the authors have performed any experiments to study the overall performance as a function of video length. Are the global features still useful for very long videos, for example? It would be useful to mention some statistics about the test video lengths for the various datasets (perhaps in a footnote if space is limited).\n\n- **Intelligibility and Quality Metrics**: Minor comment: In section 4.3, it might be useful to mention a couple of sentences about the STOI/ESTOI/PESQ metrics to help the reader understand what these capture, whether higher/lower are better and what level of differences are generally significant.\n\nTypographical and Grammatical Errors:\n1.

    "comment": "**(Q1) WER results on Table1 and Table3**\n\n**(A1)**\nWe would like thank to the reviewer for the valuable comment. We will add the WER performances in Table 1 to show how well the reconstructed speech matches the ground-truth audio (shown in Table R3_1). For Table 3, we report the WER performances obtained using Google API below in Table R3_2, but we would like to clarify why we did not include them in the original manuscript. TCD-TIMIT database [R8] is originally proposed to analyze the relation of phonemes and visemes using the paired audio-visual corpus. Therefore, the utterances are designed to cover overall phonemes and visemes. This is the reason that many previous works that utilized the TCD-TIMIT database report viseme-level or phoneme-level performance (PER) [R8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] instead of using word-level performance (WER) that is barely used for the dataset. Moreover, the dataset is composed of small training samples (377 for each Lip speaker) to train the ASR model compared to GRID (1,000 for each speaker) while containing more words. This leads not enough performance (42% WER / 13% CER) of the ASR model trained with TCD-TIMIT to evaluate the generated speech.\n\n- **Table R3_1** WER performances on multi-speaker setting on GRID (will be added in Table1) \n| Baseline | + Visual context attention | + Synchronization | + Multi-discriminators | \n|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:| \n| 5.434% | 5.015% | 4.908% | 4.797% | \n\n- **Table R3_2** WER performances on constrained-speaker setting on TCD-TIMIT\n| Vid2Speech [R1] | Ephrat et al. [R2] | Lip2AudSpec [R3] | 1D GAN-based [R10] | Lip2Wav [R4] | **VCA-GAN** |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| 75.52% | 61.86% | 49.13% | 53.52% | 31.26% | 49.09% |\n\n---\n\n**(Q2) The effect of capturing global context**\n\n**(A2)**\nIn order to confirm the effectiveness of capturing global context on generating speech, we added WER results in Table R3_1. The improved WER performance implies the synthesized speech contains clearer wordings. Moreover, please note that the performance improvement in Table 1 is the largest when the proposed visual context attention is applied.\n\n---\n\n**(Q3) Length of test videos**\n\n**(A3)**\nThe test videos of GRID have a fixed frame length of 75 and are used to train with randomly sampled 40 frames. We experimentally found that the training with sampled frames (i.e., 40) instead of the entire frames (i.e., 75 frames) is beneficial to the final performance. This could be the reason for the data augmentation effects. Moreover, please find the attention map shown in Figure 1 in the supplementary. It shows the audio-visual attention map during the test (i.e., 75 frames). We can find that the audio-visual attention well attends to the global visual feature and its neighborhoods in accordance with the corresponding audio frame. This is because of the shift-invariant property of convolution and the effectiveness of scaled dot product attention on sequence modelling that is proven in the natural language processing area [R27].\nIn order to analyze the effect of training with smaller chunks on the inference phase that using full video, we evaluate the model trained with 40 frames using different video lengths (75 frames to 750 frames) in the inference phase. The videos longer than 75 frames are obtained by repeating the original inference video. And we find that there is minor performance degradation in the three speech quality metrics (STOI, ESTOI, and PESQ) for very long videos as shown in Table R3_3.\nTherefore, in practice, our model is valid to accept up to 10 times the length of those used during training to expect inference of good quality.\n\n- **Table R3_3** Speech quality scores of different inference frame lengths\n| Frame Length | STOI | ESTOI | PESQ |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|75|0.755|0.612|2.167|\n|375|0.752|0.609|2.143|\n|750|0.755|0.605|2.132|\n\n---\n\n**(Q4) Intelligibility and Quality Metrics**\n\n**(A4)**\nAs per the reviewers\u2019 suggestion, we add the description for three speech quality metrics as follows,\n\nSTOI(Short Term Objective Intelligibility) and ESTOI(Extended Short Term Objective Intelligibility) are metrics for measuring the intelligibility of speech audio, and higher scores mean better intelligibility of speech audio. PESQ(Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) is a metric for measuring the perceptual quality of speech audio. The score is varying from -0.5 to 4.5 and a higher score means the better perceptual quality of speech audio. WER(Word Error Rate) measures how correct the predicted text from the generated speech is, using an ASR model. A low error rate implies better-generated audio in both intelligibility and quality.\n\n---\n\n**(Q5) Typographical and Grammatical errors**\n\n**(A5)**\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for the valuable comment.

    "comment": "**(Q1) About GAN-based prior work** \n\n**(A1)**\nWe would like to clarify that the GAN-based prior work \u201cVideo-Driven Speech Reconstruction using Generative Adversarial Work\u201d [R10] is different from our work. Even though they used GAN to generate speech, their GAN model is a 1D-based model that directly predicts the speech in a raw waveform. However, it is well-known that generating raw waveform directly is difficult due to the lack of suitable loss functions (e.g., L1 loss). In contrast, we consider the spectrogram as an image that represents time and spectral features with its width and height respectively, so we adopted a 2D GAN technique with a reconstruction loss function. Therefore, we redesigned not only the hierarchical architecture but also the whole generation framework composed of 2D image generation with explicit modelling of global and local representations, which is distinct to the 1D GAN-based prior work [R10].\n\n---\n\n**(Q2) About homophenes & Global visual context in alleviating the ambiguity of homophenes** \n\n**(A2)**\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. Firstly, we would like to clarify that the word \u201chomophone\u201d used in the manuscript is intended to mean a set of words that shows the same lip movements (i.e., visemes) with different pronunciations (i.e., phonemes) rather than different written forms but having identical spoken forms. We note that the correct word for describing this is \"homophene\" not \"homophone\" and is used without clear distinction in previous works (homophone in [R14], homophene in [R4]). We will modify the word \u201chomophone\u201d used in the manuscript to \u201chomophene\u201d for a clear description.\n\nSuch homophenes include \u2018m\u2019, \u2018b\u2019, and \u2019p\u2019 (e.g., mark, bark, and park) and they are cannot be distinguished by watching the lip movement only. In order to correctly distinguish the homophenes, the context should be considered (e.g., go to a mark for rest vs. go to a bark for rest vs. go to a park for rest). This is the motivation of our work that previous works which predict the auditory feature from a short video clip could fail on distinguishing the homophenes. In the proposed method, the global-level information capturing the context can provide additional information besides the local-level information so that the generator can synthesize the speech by distinguishing the homophenes.\n\n---\n\n**(Q3) Choice of synchronization**\n\n**(A3)**\nThe choice of using cosine similarity and learning a shared latent space of visual and audio modalities are motivated by the modern success in audio-video synchronization research [R32]. In [R32], the authors showed that contrastive learning using audio-video data is effective in learning synchronized audio-video representations. Moreover, they showed that contrastive learning (i.e., learning shared latent space) is beneficial to the lip-reading task by obtaining more discriminative representations in a self-supervised manner. Therefore, we adopted their idea to synthesize synchronized audio representation with input video and detailed speech.\nTo verify that this choice improves the quality of generated speech, we additionally report WER performances that reflect the clarity of the generated speech in Table R2_1. The WER is measured by using a pre-trained ASR model trained on the same multi-speaker setting on GRID. By using the synchronization, the WER improves about 0.1%. This improvement results from our training strategy where the model learns discriminative representation through contrastive learning.\n\n- **Table R2_1** WER performances on multi-speaker setting on GRID (will be added in Table1)\n| Baseline | + Visual context attention | + Synchronization | + Multi-discriminators |\n|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n| 5.434% | 5.015% | 4.908% | 4.797% |\n\nMoreover, the red-boxed region of mel-spectrogram in the third column of Fig.2 in the supplemental material shows that the blurry synthesized region becomes clearer with the synchronization learning.\n\n---\n\n**(Q4) Table 2 sorting**\n\n**(A4)**\nWe sorted the methods by published date. Thus, the lower placed method is the more recent method.\n\n---\n\n**(Q5) Table 2 ASR performance**\n\n**(A5)**\nAs per the reviewer\u2019s comment, we will remove the WER performance measured by pre-trained ASR from Table 2.\n\n---\n\n**(Q6) WER comparison on LRW dataset**\n\n**(A6)**\nAs per the reviewer\u2019s comment, we will leave the comparison out for the WER performance on LRW dataset in the manuscript.\n\n---\n\n**(Q7) Subjective measurement of the value for synchronization**\n\n**(A7)**\nFor evaluating the synchronization, we used two metrics for measuring the synchronization. First is the human subjective evaluation (MOS test) shown in Table 4. The second is using metrics proposed to measure the synchronization, LSE-C and LSE-D, shown in Table 9 in the supplementary. Please note that the baseline model without the proposed synchronization achieves 7.055 LSE-D (lower is better) and 6.193 LSE-C (higher is better). The 1D GAN-based method [R10] achieves 8.107 LSE-D and 4.797 LSE-C, the Vocoder-based method [R12] achieves 6.717 LSE-D and 6.178 LSE-C, and the proposed VCA-GAN achieves 6.698 LSE-D and 6.373 LSE-C. From the two results, we can confirm the synthesized speech from the proposed method is well synchronized with the input lip video.\n\n---\n\n**Ethical concerns** \n\nAs the reviewer pointed out, as many beneficial techniques also have their negative social effects, the Lip2Speech or Lip-reading technologies might be misused for harmful forms of surveillance. However, we expect the concern for the negative social effects of the technology to be resolved if the technique is made use of within the border of appropriate legal systems. For example, permission to use the technology in a hospital is very beneficial for conversation with the patients who cannot make voice, and it is already under trial runs in the UK (https://www.sravi.ai/). Another example, permission to use the technology for police can prevent crimes or boost criminal investigation. Therefore, in order to highlight the positive societal effects while preventing the side effects, the development of Lip2Speech or Lip-reading technologies should be processed along with the legal systems.\n\n---\n\n[R#] represents the reference # in the manuscript.\n",

It is unclear what the difference between the last row of Table 1 and the last row of Table 6, both representing VCA-GAN but with minor performance difference - good to clarify. While the ablation study shows each component contributes to the performance improvement, but the improvement brought by each component is rather small.

    "comment": "**(Q1) The performance difference between Table 1 and Table 6**\n\n**(A1)**\nWe thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. As the reviewer pointed out, the reported performances for the three speech quality metrics of Table 6 are mistyped. The performances of VCA-GAN in Table 6 should be revised to 0.736, 0.604, 1.961, 1.8%, and 4.8%, for STOI, ESTOI, PESQ, CER, and WER, respectively.\n\n---\n\n**(Q2) Rather small improvement by each component**\n\n**(A2)**\nFirstly, we kindly point out that the performance improvement of 0.01 in STOI and 0.05 in PESQ are not so marginal. Please note that the recent state-of-the-art methods [R4, R11, R12] (published in 2020-2021) are competing within 0.007 STOI and 0.03 PESQ scores as shown in Table 2. Moreover, we additionally report WER performances for the ablation study shown in Table R1_1, and the results show about 0.6% improvement by applying all three components together.\n\n- **Table R1_1** WER performances on multi-speaker setting on GRID (will be added in Table1)\n| Baseline | + Visual context attention | + Synchronization | + Multi-discriminators |\n|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n| 5.434% | 5.015% | 4.908% | 4.797% |\n\nSecondly, we would like to clarify that the \u201cBaseline\u201d in Table 1 results from one of our contributions (Contribution 2 in Introduction). To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that predicts the spectrogram from silent lip video by adopting the image generation technique. In this paper, we synthesized the mel-spectrogram as an image using 2D GAN. Since the value of mel-spectrogram is smooth and it gradually changes over time compared to the raw waveform format, adopting the image generation technique is effective for predicting the spoken speech from silent lip movements. Therefore, our \u201cBaseline\u201d model, one of our contributions, basically achieves high performance in all three speech quality metrics. In order to verify that our \u201cBaseline\u201d model is comparable with previous methods, we report the performance of \u201cBaseline\u201d in constrained speaker setting on GRID dataset (STOI: 0.7196, ESTOI: 0.5984, PESQ: 1.9602). In addition to the \u201cBaseline\u201d architecture, we improve the performance by proposing the visual context attention module, synchronization learning, and multi-scale generation. The ablation study shown in Table 1 verifies that each proposed method can further improve the speech synthesis performance.\n\n---\n\n**(Q3) About metrics for synchronization**\n\n**(A3)**\nFor measuring synchronization, we utilized two different metrics. The first is human subjective evaluation shown in Table 4. The second is quantitative results shown in Table 9 in supplementary using LSE-D (higher is better) and LSE-C (lower is better) that measure the degree of synchronization of audio and video. Please note that the baseline model without synchronization learning achieves 7.055 LSE-D and 6.193 LSE-C. The 1D GAN-based method [R10] achieves 8.107 LSE-D and 4.797 LSE-C, the Vocoder-based method [R12] achieves 6.717 LSE-D and 6.178 LSE-C, and the proposed VCA-GAN achieves **6.698** LSE-D and **6.373** LSE-C. The two results confirm that the proposed method is effective in synthesizing synchronized speech from the silent lip video.\n\n---\n\n[R#] represents the reference # in the manuscript.\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for the review. We address the main points below: \n\n```\n> CodeGPT was not designed to be used in this way.\n```\n\n\nIt is true that CodeGPT was not designed for this kind of whole-method-body generation. However, we needed a transformer baseline to compare with, and CodeGPT was the most reasonable transformer baseline we found. We tried our best to make it fit our setup. That said, after reading the reveiwer's comment, we are sensitive to the possibility our experiments portray CodeGPT in a negative light, when we are in fact using it in a way that its designers did not consider. When revising the paper, we will make the imperfect match between CodeGPT and our task clearer, to ensure we do not unfairly impugn the method.\n\n\n```\n> The appendix suggests that this model was trained with a sequence length of up to 512 tokens, which tends to (far) exceed the size of typical files. Please clarify how this impacted the model.\n```\n\nWe chose a window size of 512 as this number is common in transformer models of code (for example, the CodeBERT paper uses a window of 512 as well). As mentioned in our response to R3 (3UN5), candidate training examples that required a window longer than 512 tokens were eliminated. This criterion reduced the size of our training set by 30%, but still left us with a training dataset of size 3.3M.             \n\n\n```\n> Table 1: consider adding a \"totals\" row, to make it easier to assess the overall performance of these models.

    "comment": "Thank you for your comments. We address the main points in the review below: \n\n```\n>  It is possible that the gains from the static analysis will disappear once the transformer models are big enough.\n```\n\nThis may indeed be the case. That said, the transformer baseline tested (CodeGPT) already has an advantage over our model in terms of size. Specifically, our model has ~63M parameters, whereas CodeGPT has ~124M parameters. While the performance of the transformer baseline is likely to go up with more parameters, we could also provide commensurately more parameters to our learning model and make it perform better.  \n\nThe question, then, is: would the growth in the performance of the transformer with increased size far outpace our model? This is possible, and should be investigated in future work. \n\nAs a separate point, we believe that parameter-efficiency in a model can be valuable in itself. For example, one could train such a model on a single GPU (as we have done in this work) and run it on a memory-limited device. The prior knowledge needed to achieve this  parameter-efficiency comes for free (from the language semantics) in our setting. \n\n```\n> We change local variable and method names to generic names such as var_1. This prevents our model from learning the soft information provided by variable names.\n```\n\n\nThis is a very good point.  On one hand, there is (likely) an advantage to treating variable names as tokens that are part of a grammar: it makes it easy to include information about variables in the attribute grammar, and presumably easier for the model to learn to use them.  That said, this comes at a cost: \"var_1\" has less information about programmer intent than \"myFileReader\".  Retaining this soft information somehow may boost accuracy, and is a good idea to consider.\n\n```\n> Why not use BLEU scores as the evaluation metric?\n```\nThere are some basic problems with using BLEU scores in the code generation setting. We use one of the examples in Table 3 of the paper (\"reading from a file\") to illustrate this point. Here, the ground-truth code is: \n\n```\npublic String reader(){\n\tStringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer(); \n\tString line; \n\twhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n\t\tstringBuffer.append(line);\n\t\tstringBuffer.append(\"\\n\");\n\t} \n\treturn stringBuffer.toString();\n}\n```\n\nThe CodeGPT output is:\n\n```\npublic String reader(){\n\tStringBuffer buffer=new StringBuffer();\n\tbuffer.append(\"\\n\");\n\treturn buffer.toString();\n}\n```\nThe NSG output is: \n\n```\npublic String reader(){\n\tjava.lang.String var_9; \n\ttry {var_9=field_5.readLine();\n\t} catch(IOException var_8) {\n\t\tvar_8.printStackTrace();\n\t}\n\treturn var_9;\n}\n```\n\nThe NSG output is clearly better. However, the CodeGPT output gets a higher BLEU score because it uses variable names that superficially match the ground-truth.  Specifically, the BLEU score of the CodeGPT output is 25.11 and the BLEU score of the NSG output is 19.07.\n\n\nThis kind of situation arose often in our tasks, and this is why we did not use BLEU score as a metric.\n\n```\n> The evaluation does not include test cases on which the code is directly executed.\n```\nThis is a great point. The static analysis checks performed during our evaluation are an approximate semantics check. But this checking could be expanded with stronger specifications such as test cases. We are actively exploring this direction in current work using a combination of classical program synthesis and NSG-style models.\n\n```\nWas the context size of 512 tokens, used for CodeGPT, large enough to include both the relevant specification (surrounding code) as well as the generated method body?\n```\n\n\nThe CodeGPT model was trained on a sequence of tokens consisting of class name, class-instance variables, and sequence of method headers of surrounding code, followed by the method header of the unknown method. The training is on the method header (and the original method body does not count toward the 512 tokens). Candidate training examples (without the method body) that were longer than 512 tokens were eliminated from the training set. This criterion for selecting training examples reduced the size of our training set by 30%. However, we had a dataset of size 3.3M training examples even after this reduction, which we believe is sufficient for fine tuning.

    "review": "The paper considers the challenging and important task of conditional program generation, an area of increasing interest at NeurIPS in recent years. The main weakness identified, that neural models of source code usually struggle with generation of long sections of code, is important. Being able to generate long semantically coherent programs is a key challenge in the field, and this paper presents an approach to program generation that deals with this effectively.\n\nThe method is explained clearly overall, providing background on static analysis with attribute grammars and a clear explanation of the algorithm for using such a static analysis during program generation, compatible with a wide class of models. The appendix provides the details that were omitted from the main paper, including how the training data is prepared, the attributes considered and part of the definition of the attribute grammar, how attributes are encoded, and details about the main and baseline methods.\n\nA key element of the approach is the attribute grammar defines a linear path through the program, allowing the model to be trained using pre-computed attributes and requiring on-the-fly computation of attributes during inference. This is explained best in the training and inference appendix.\n\nA strength of the approach, and an advantage over prior work, is that the method allows for learning constraints and guiding principles from the input corpus, rather than using the static analysis to provide hard constraints. This gives more freedom to the static analysis designer to include attributes that correspond to best-practices or that appear only in certain contexts, without needing to avoid attributes that don't define hard-and-fast rules about programs. Prior work leveraging attribute grammars for program generation used them to enforce hard constraints.\n\nA weakness is that the evaluation static checks match those properties provided by the static analysis attribute grammar. I would be interested to see an evaluation indicating whether the method learns to preserve additional properties beyond those directly measured by the static analysis. Perhaps to that end, please clarify what is meant by 50% evidence. Does this refer to full evidence at 50% of nodes, or 50% evidence at each node? How is the 50% selected? Outside of these concerns, the evaluation is solid. The task and baselines are appropriate, the metrics capture properties of interest, and the evidence from the results tells a quite clear story. Including a measure of spread would improve the results section.\n\n---\n\nLine 71: $\\delta$ accepts programs as inputs, but in the prediction error expression $\\textbf{E}_{(X,Y)\\sim D}[\\delta(P_\\theta(X|Y), Y)]$ you incorrectly pass $P_\\theta(X|Y)$, rather than a program, as the first input to $\\delta$.\n\nNit: Line 165 refers to specification Y rather than specification X.\n\nLine 765 has a broken reference simply appearing as \"??\".",
    "comment": "We really appreciate your feedback. We address the main points in the review below: \n\n```\n> Can our model preserve additional properties beyond those directly measured by the static analysis?\n```\n\nAs the reviewer implies, there may be families of program properties that are closely related to each other. For a simple example, type-safe Java programs do not read from uninitialized variables. This means that a model trained on type-safety attributes will be likely to produce programs in which all variables are initialized before use. \n\nOne way to evaluate this question will be through an ablation study in which we reduce the set of attributes available to the model as inputs during training and inference, but we check all the properties that we currently check, to see if some of the properties are satisfied \"for free\". If the reviewer feels this is useful, we can perform such a study for the final version of the paper.\n\n```\n> What does \"50% evidence\" mean?\n```\n\nFirst, let us re-state that \"evidence\" (as defined in Section 2) refers to the context in the surrounding code (method names, method headers, Java Doc comments, class variables, etc.) upon which generation of a Java method is conditioned. Suppose we are trying to generate a method body M. When we use \"x% evidence\" for this task, each piece of evidence in the code surrounding M is selected with independent probability x% to be part of the evidence set. \n\nFor example, if a test class has 4 methods, their names can each be used as evidence from the surrounding context to predict the body of the 5th method M. In the \"50% evidence\" scenario in our experiments,  each of these 4 names has a 50% chance of being part of the \"method names\" evidence set. The use of such incomplete evidence sets is inspired by real-world programming scenarios in which a user wants to auto-complete the next method in a class in which much of the code is unwritten. \n\nWe agree that these points were not fully clear in the draft we submitted. We will clarify this in more detail in the final version with clear examples. \n\n\n```\n> Typos/errors in Line 71, 165 and 765\n```\nThank you for pointing out these errors. We will correct them in the revision.",

    "comment": "Thank you for your comments. We respond to the main points in the review below: \n\n\n```\n> \"Characterizing [GNN2NAG] as \"next token prediction\" is unfair... \n```\nThank you for this feedback. We will revise the referenced statement along the lines you suggest.\n\n\n```\n> It would be interesting to see how GNN2NAG fares against NSG for in-method expression completion (medium horizon).\n```\nAgreed. We are currently working to set up this experiment and will add the results from it to the final version of the paper. \n\n\n```\n> We should compare with the GPT-NEO or GPT-J transformers. \n```\nThank you for these pointers. We have begun looking into these baselines and will try to experimentally compare against GPT-NEO in the final version. \n\n\n```\n> Is the NSG model robust to presence or absence of attributes at test time, for example, because the code/linker is in a broken state?\n```\n\nThis is a great question. Our guess is that the NSG model will not work very well if attributes are missing at test time. For example, suppose the model has learned a type safety feature that relates the type of a variable in the symbol table with the way it is used in a production rule. If the variable is missing from the symbol table during testing (because of a broken compiler), the model might take it as a signal to not invoke that rule. \n\nThat said, this hunch should be experimentally validated. We will perform this experiment and discuss it in the final paper.\n\n\n```\n> Section 4 ends abruptly and doesn't discuss the instantiation of NSGs for Java.\n```\n\n\nWe will rewrite Section 4, reducing the overlap with Murali et al. and discussing in more detail how the model is instantiated for Java and specific static analyses. \n\n```\n> In addition to conditioning on attributes, the model could be trained to predict them as an auxiliary task. Multitask learning has improved performance or accelerated training in many domains, code could work just as well.\n```\n\nThis is a very interesting future direction. It is conceivable that any language model, if applied to code, could see a significant accuracy boost if trained to predict semantic attributes. Semantic attributes could be seen as hidden variables, present during training but absent during inference, where the actual code text is conditioned upon the value of those variables.  There may be advantages to this approach compared to what we have proposed; in partciular, very heavy-weight semantic analyses could be used, that are not appropriate for use at inference time.\n\n```\n> There are many other methods to integrate tree structure and generative transformers that we should discuss.\n```\nWe agree and will discuss these methods in the related work in the final version.\n\n```\n> How much of the attribute vocabulary could be shared cross-language?\n```\nAnother interesting question. As it happens, we are actively pursuing cross-language training, built on top of an LLVM-based, source-language-agnostic static analysis infrastructure, as a follow-up research direction. We will mention this ongoing work in the conclusion of the revised paper. \n\n```\n> The general line of reasoning that \"semantics are hard to learn from syntax\" is not wrong, but comes with caveats. \n```\n\n\nWe agree. We will discuss these points in more depth, and cite the [Codex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374) paper,  in the revision. ",

However, it is not uncommon in the Wasserstein distance literature to solve that kind of problems on a case by case basis, as pointed out by the authors in their response to Reviewer 61bD. While these issues make the application of the proposed bounds not straightforward, I do believe that they are significant, as mentioned by Reviewer Bm5Z. In particular, the proposed bounds seem easier to implement than previous ones (e.g., those by Wang et al.) and, as evidenced by their toy example, they seem to remain tight despite their \"simplicity\".\n\nWhile there are non-trivial problems yet to solve, this paper seems to lay down a very promising framework to derive practical generalization bounds based on Wasserstein distance.

    "comment": "Dear Reviewer Bm5Z,\n\nThank you for reviewing and assessing our paper. We will respond to your remarks (in order) below. We will first re-write your comments/questions and will follow them with our answers.\n\n* **Reviewer**:  Example 1 shows that the proposed method could provide an order optimal bound for the generalization error of Gaussian mean estimation problem, which seems to be the first order optimal information-theoretic bound based on my knowledge. It was shown in [6] that simply using individual mutual information $I(W;Z_i)$ will result in a sub-optimal bound, so I would like the author to provide more explanation and discussion about this improvements. It seems that the improvement is related to the metric used in the Wasserstein distance.\n\n    **Answer**: The particular example of the Gaussian location model illustrates two benefits from bounds based on the Wasserstein distance compared to those based on the relative entropy and the mutual information.\n    \n    * The pitfall of potentially infinite bounds is erased. The bound based on the mutual information $I(W;S)$ is infinite since $W$ is a deterministic function of $S$ and $S$ is a continuous random variable. Conversely, the Wasserstein distance $\\mathbb{W}(P_{W|S},P_W) \\in \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 d / n})$.\n        \n    * The bound is linear with the metric. In this particular example of comparing Gaussians, the mutual information of $W$ and $Z_i$ is quite good in capturing how far apart are the joint and product distributions of the random variables, it is actually rate-optimal: $I(W;Z_i) = \\log \\big(\\frac{n}{n-1} \\big) \\in \\mathcal{O}(1/n)$.\n        However, it has the pitfall that the bound is *not* linear on $I(W;Z_i)$, but on $\\sqrt{I(W;Z_i)}$.\n        Nonetheless, the Wasserstein distance is also good at capturing the distance between the posterior and prior distributions of the hypothesis and it is also rate optimal: $\\mathbb{W}(P_{W|{Z_i}},P_W) \\in \\mathcal{O}(1/n)$.\n        The advantage here is that the bound *is* linear with this metric.\n        Therefore, relative-ntropy--based bounds always have a square root disadvantage with respect to Wasserstein-distance--based bounds.\n    \n    There are other situations where the usage of the metric could be more beneficial when compared to the relative entropy. For instance, for discrete distributions. Here, if the forward channel does not place some probability to all of the possible hypotheses, then the relative entropy explodes. Moreover, if there is no geometry to exploit such as in a categorical distribution and the loss is bounded, e.g. 0-1 loss, then employing the Wasserstein distance with the discrete metric (i.e. the total variation) will always give a tighter bound due to Pinsker's inequality.\n\n* **Reviewer**:  The results presented in section 3.3 and 3.4 are quite straight forward, and it is hard for me to see the values of those results based on the discussion in the current paper. More discussion and some potential applications of these results would be helpful. Otherwise, there is no reason to include some looser bounds in the main body of the paper.\n\n    **Answer**: These results are included to showcase the versatility that the Wasserstein distance bounds have. As mentioned to reviewer 61bD, the bounds based on the backward channel are included due to two main reasons: \n    1. The fact that this channel has been useful in the information theory community to characterize the rate--distortion function in the past. Therefore, we consider that this result may be useful to other people with that background, or others who may be capable to describe the backward channel for their particular application.\n\n    2. The fact that sometimes employing the geometric information of the sample space is more useful than employing the geometric information of the hypothesis space. For instance, imagine a scenario where the loss function $\\ell(w,z)$ is not Lipschitz with respect to $w$, but it is Lipschitz with respect to $z$  (e.g., hinge, logistic, or Huber losses [24]) and assume also that the sample space has a bounded diameter. Then, even if you only know $P_{W|Z_i}$, you can reach a useful bound with the following steps:\n\n        1. realize that the backward channel bound in terms of the Wasserstein distance holds, \n    \n        2. get the total variation bound as shown in Appendix A.2,\n    \n        3. use the fact that the total variation is an $f$-divergence and therefore by Jensen's inequality and [Poliansky 2019, Prop. 7.1-4] you may bound that by the total variation between the joint distribution $P_{W,Z_i}$ and the product distribution $P_W \\otimes P_{Z_i}$, and finally\n    \n        4. characterize the bound with the total variation or any other $f$-divergence that you know how to compute by means of the joint-range strategy.\n\n    This second point is also related to why we included some examples of the obtainable bounds with the joint range strategy.\n    We wanted to showcase that these results open the floor to measure the stability of the algorithms with many different metrics, since sometimes one cannot prove analytically that the Wasserstein distance or the relative entropy are small, but maybe can do so for the Hellinger distance.\n    Then, using the bound from section 3.4, if $H(P_{W|Z_i},P_W) \\in \\mathcal{O}(1/\\text{poly}(n))$, then $\\overline{\\text{gen}}(W,S) \\in \\mathcal{O}(1/\\text{poly}(n))$.\n\n    ```Y. Poliansky. 1st lecture notes for the course \"Information Theoretic Methods in Statistics and Computer Science\" 2019-2020. ```\n\n* **Reviewer:** The comparison of the Wasserstein distance-based bounds presented in Appendix C should be included in the main body of the paper to demonstrate the tightness of the proposed bound. It would also be helpful to construct a table which summarizes the comparisons between all these bounds.\n\n    **Answer:** This is a great idea that will improve the reader experience, thank you. We now included an informal proposition right before Example 1 summarizing the relationships between the different Wasserstein distance bounds. \n    \n    As for the table, we also think this is a great idea, but unfortunately due to page limitations we are unable to include that in the main text. As suggested by Reviewer SCNA, we will create a figure summarizing the comparisons between all these bounds, but it will have to be delegated to Appendix C.\n\n* **Reviewer**: The ICIMI bound from [12] could be added in Figure 1 as another baseline.\n\n    **Answer**: The bound from [12] is calculated with the squared $\\ell_2$ norm and not the $\\ell_2$ norm. In order to include this bound as a baseline, the conditional CGF using the squared $\\ell_2$ norm should be calculated, which is a complicated task. Moreover, given that the bound from [12] has the same rate as [6] for the squared $\\ell_2$ norm and the bound from [6] has the same rate for both the $\\ell_2$ and squared $\\ell_2$ norm, we anticipate that the order of such a bound will also be sub-optimal, that is $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$.\n",

    "review": "\n-The Wasserstien distance is defined using a metric. The most important shortcoming I found with the paper is that there is no discussion on how we can find an appropriate metric for the hypothesis space. I just want to emphasize that the concept of using the geometry of the hypothesis space has been used in learning theory before. For instance for VC classes this seminal work considers the VC classes:\n\n\tHaussler, David. \"Sphere packing numbers for subsets of the Boolean n-cube with bounded Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension.\" Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 69.2 (1995): 217-232.\n\nLater it was used for obtaining bounds on the Radmacher complexity by chaining technique. Another question is what is the impact of the algorithm on the chosen metric? Assume we have a hypothesis space and two different algorithms for learning. Do we need to choose different metrics when analyzing different algorithms for the same hypothesis space?\n\n-The concept of chaining mutual information bounds has been considered in [13], [11], and a recent work by Asadi, Abbe where the authors propose a learning algorithm based on their chaining method. I just want to understand what are the main differences of this paper compared to those results? The aforementioned papers  also provide bounds that depend on the learning algorithm as well as the geometry of the space.\n\n-The example of the Gaussian location model implies that in some cases the proposed bounds can give much tighter characterization of the generalization bound.  Is there any specific practical problem that your generalization bound can give new insights and analysis? Also, does this generalization bound guide us to design a new training algorithm?\n\n-Most of the results in the paper depends on the distribution of output conditioned on a single sample, i.e., P(W|Z_i). I think in most problems it should be hard to quantify this kernel. The authors also discuss the bounds that depend on P(W|S) however those bounds are much looser. Is there any way to improve the bounds based on P(W|S)?\n\n-Another important property of the Wasserstein distance is that it is defined based on \u201cinf\u201d over the coupling. However, in the paper there is no discussion on how to find a good coupling? I think the authors should also comment on this aspect.\n\n-Theorem 2: why do you want to add extra info R? I think we can add extra information by considering a specific coupling.\n\n-Backward channel: I could not understand what is the main idea behind considering backward channel? I think characterizing the kernel P(S|W) is a very very hard problem. How can we use this bound in practice to gain a new insight? I would appreciate it if the authors comment on why they consider the backward channel in the paper. I have looked at the appendix on the connection to the rate distortion theory, but that section is not very clear.\n\n\nSome typos:\nWhat does the word \u201csingle letter\u201d mean in the paper? \nLine 33, there are three and in a row and it is difficult to understand the sentence.\nLine 38, what is j?\nLine 151: in the first sentence it seems there is a typo.\n\n",
    "comment": "Dear Authors,\n\nI would like to thank the authors for their detailed responses. However, if accepted, the authors should very carefully address the following: \n\n1) Chaining method for MI bounds and PAC-Bayes bounds: As discussed in the response letter, there are results providing generalization bounds that are both considering the geometry and the learning algorithm. I think the authors should clearly discuss the differences between their approach and the existing results. Also, the authors should cite [a,b]. \n2) How to find a metric to obtain a tightest possible bound: I found the response by the authors interesting, and they should include the discussion in the paper.\n3) How to find coupling so that the bound can be evaluated: My main concern is that finding a \"good\" coupling is too cumbersome so it limits the applications of the bounds to toy examples. Nonetheless, I think the results in this paper can be a starting point to address this issue in case-by-case scenarios.\n\nSpecifically, I think it would be nice if the authors provide detailed discussion in the paper for the aforementioned points.

    "review": "The first four main results of the paper are for single-letter and random-subset generalization bounds in the standard and randomized-subsample settings. Note that in the latter setting, twice the typical number of samples are drawn, but coin flips are used to decide which subset of those samples is actually used; the distributions considered differ in whether the results of those coin flips / the identities of the samples are known. The bounds in the standard setting are showcased by considering a particular application regarding estimating the mean of a Gaussian distribution given its covariance matrix and comparing the proposed bounds to previous Wasserstein / mutual information bounds. Since this setting is simple, the precise generalization error can be computed and is plotted as well; the new bounds are much closer to the correct generalization error than previous work.\n\nThe paper then also discusses how the results above can be made to work with backward channels instead of forward channels (e.g. how knowing the hypothesis changes the distribution over samples), as well as how they can be converted to other information measures, such as launtum information.\n\nOverall, I think this is a thorough collection of theory results that pushes the boundaries relative to a variety of prior work.

    "comment": "Dear Reviewer EsUW, \n\nThank you for reviewing and assessing our paper. Please, let us answer to your comments below.\n\nRegarding the limitations and societal impact:\n\nAs noted, the Wasserstein distance is complicated to characterize and/or estimate. Nonetheless, there are two points we want to note in favor of the presented results in terms of their practicality:\n    \n1. The bounds based on the Wasserstein distance allow us to generate new bounds in terms of the easier to estimate relative entropy, which already improve upon previous results. For instance, there are two ways in which the proposed bounds can tighten previous ones: \n    * the BH inequality prevents that the larger relative entropy values make the bound vacuous. Therefore, Cor.  1 improves upon  [6, Prop.  1] and Cor.  2 improves upon [7, Th. 2.5], and\n    * it pulls the expectation with respect to the samples, e.g., $P_{Z_i}$, outside of the square root, thus improving the bound due to Jensen's gap. Hence, this way Cor.  1 further improves upon [6, Prop.  1]. Note that, in certain cases, this gap grows as $\\Theta(\\sigma_\\alpha^\\alpha)$, where $\\sigma_\\alpha$ is the $\\alpha$ absolute central moment [Gao 2019]. Therefore, the current practical bounds on logistic regression, Gaussian Processes, and SGLD (assuming a bounded loss) from [6] are readily tightened.\n\n    ```Xiang Gao, Meera Sitharam, Adrian E. Roitberg, \"Bounds on the Jensen Gap, and implications for mean-concentrated distributions\", AJMAA```\n\n2. In this paper, we show evidence (see Example 1) that the characterization of the generalization error via Wasserstein distance can be tight. We hope that this realization can serve as motivation for further research in the theory of Wasserstein distance characterization and estimation.\n\n    We are particularly hopeful due to recent results on Wasserstein distance estimation [Rowland 2019, Chizat 2020, and Staerman 2022].

We answer your questions as follows:\n\n- IT-GAN (Q), IT-GAN, and IT-GAN (L) can show the ablation study on the likelihood regularization, which is our main ablation study direction. We will also add one more loss definition suggested by the reviewer vTau, i.e., a convex weighted sum of the two real and fake discriminator losses with various weight combinations. We could achieve sub-optimal outcomes for it, e.g., an F-1 score of 0.62 for Adult vs. 0.64 with our method. For other datasets, it also shows sub-optimal outcomes. We will add these experimental results to our paper.\n\n- We will better highlight the role of each network in our model. We agree that our model design is a little more complicated than other standard GANs. Invertible neural networks require that the output size is the same as the input size. Our invertible generator\u2019s latent vector input size should be the same as the output hidden vector size. The main purpose of adding the autoencoder is to match the input and the output sizes of the invertible generator.\n\n- We will correct Line 279 following your suggestion.

    "review": "Overall the paper, provides a novel architecture which combines a number of different ideas for synthesising tabular data. The paper is well written and clear. The ideas composition of previous architectures is also interesting. The only notable flaw is that the angle in which privacy is examined is only examined experimentally with no theoretic analysis. However, the large coverage of experiments helps provide evidence for this approach.\n\nOriginality & Significance: Although the individual components of the architecture are not novel, their composition appears to be. One fact which could hurt novelty is if the composition of AE and GAN has been used before. If so, this should be highlighted in prior work. The use of the invertible generator is also very interesting.\n\nQuality & Clarity: The paper seems to be technically sound with a nice and extensive experimental section. The only issue is the lack of runtime and architecture size comparisons. The paper is also well written. Although the heavy notation in the specification of the architecture hurts clarity a bit.\n\nStrengths:\n  - The combination of AE, GAN, and invertible generator is neat.\n  - The log-density likelihood regularizer/loss function is interesting. It seems that this can also be used to make different partitions of real world data more likely (i.e., create a specialized generator by rewarding/penalizing different subsets of the training data).\n\nWeaknesses/Suggestions/Questions:\n  - The notation of the loss function in (9) suggest that the regularity/sparsity terms only depend on the fake data. If so, why not have this also depend on the training data/real records?\n  - What is the runtime compared to baselines? How does your proposed architecture compare in the number of parameters to baselines?\n  - Is there a way to relate the log-density regularizer and the fake-real distance other definitions of privacy? (differential privacy?)\n  - There seems to be a missing point of comparison when the log-density regularizer is not used. What happens when you don't use an invertible generator?\n  - Furthermore, without the invertible generator can the log-density regularizer be substituted by just considering a convex reweighting of the discriminator error for real and fake error? (i.e., for $ \\gamma > 0 $, weight the error of discriminator for realdata being lower than that of an error for fake data)",
    "comment": "First of all, we appreciate your efforts in reading our paper and letting us know your comments. We answer your questions as follows:\n\n-\tIn Eq. (9), we found that it is a typo. In fact, we have the sparsity regularization on real records. We wrote it as h_{fake} by a mistake. We will correct this.\n-\tTGAN\u2019s parameter size is similar to ours in many cases. However, TVAE, VeeGAN, and MedGAN have approximately 60% lesser parameters. In particular, TableGAN's size is the smallest, i.e., 90% lesser parameters in comparison with ours.\n-\tIt takes a second per mini-batch iteration (the mini-batch size is 2000) for our method. TGAN\u2019s training time is 5-10 times faster than ours (because we need to solve ODEs for our method, which typically requires multiple steps) and TableGAN is 5-10 times faster than TGAN. In general, neural ordinary differential equations require longer forward and backward time than conventional neural networks.\n-\tChen et al. introduces the relationship between likelihood and membership inference attack in [5], which is one motivation of our work. However, it is unclear how we can connect it to the differential privacy for now since the differential privacy's privacy notion is more complicated.\n- Among IT-GAN (Q), IT-GAN, and IT-GAN (L), IT-GAN does not use the log-density regularization. So you can easily check the efficacy of the regularization in our result tables.\n- We constructed the loss following your suggestion, i.e., a convex weighted sum of the two real and fake discriminator losses with various weight combinations. We could achieve sub-optimal outcomes for it, e.g., an F-1 score of 0.62 for Adult vs. 0.64 with our method. For other datasets, it also shows sub-optimal outcomes.\n",

    "review": "This paper studies a relatively new and exciting question. It amasses theoretical evidence to support the use of learning methods that leverage invariance/symmetry. Unlike previous works, this paper studies a broader class of (nonsmooth) functions and assumes that the dimension is fixed and the number of samples grows.\n\nThe more substantial results derived in the paper suggest that incorporating invariance into the kernel gives gains of at most a constant factor (determined by the size of the group), and it is indicated in Section 3 that this is the best one can hope for. However, I believe the manuscript would benefit from a more in-depth explanation of optimality in this setting.\n\nAlthough the topic is highly technical, the paper is clear and reasonably easy to follow. The proofs seem to be mathematically rigorous. However, I did not check all the details. Overall the article is an interesting and well-written piece of work. Below I include a list of suggestions.\n\n- The theorem statements give upper bounds for both kernels. The results would be stronger if the statement for $\\widehat f_{\\lambda, K}$ included a lower bound.\n- The estimator is not guaranteed to be invariant under the action of the group.

So even for some infinite group, there is only a finite sample size gain. In some cases (some subgroups of permutation of polynomial size, while you can consider exponentially sized groups in your paper), the degeneracy coincides with the size of the group. While [1] fully check the conditions only for invariance by translation, I expect their proof to extend to these cases (with the added requirement $n > O(d^\\alpha)$ if $\\alpha >1$).

It would be great to clarify this in the introduction.\n\n(3) I would be more careful about claiming the factor improvement. A factor improvement in the generalization error upper bound does not necessarily imply a factor improvement in the actual generalization error. This would require to have a point wise lower bound with matching multiplicative constants (which is the case in the high-dimensional setting [1]). In particular, I am only aware of minimax lower bounds, but even in this case, the multiplicative constant can depend on the dimension. While I still believe these upper bounds are useful and match what happens in practice, I would add a paragraph discussing this point and different known lower bounds/or possible ways of obtaining them.\n\n\n[1] Learning with invariances in random features and kernel models, Mei, Misiakiewicz, Montanari (2021).\n\n\n---- Post-rebuttal ----\n\nThank you for the authors clarifications and for taking my suggestions.

    "comment": "Dear Reviewer BHMR,\n\nA few more remarks from our part:\n\n * Using standard tools from minimax lower bounds, we were able to obtain a lower bound showing that the constant C4 (and its dependence on problem parameters) can be tight in a minimax sense for non-invariant targets in a RKHS ball, at least asymptotically (in n). You are right that what we'd really want is a pointwise bound for a fixed invariant target, however this may be difficult without a precise estimation of the risk (or at least we are unaware of how to obtain them), which is where the high-dimensional analyses a la [1] really shine.\n * Regarding your second point, we realize that we had missed your remark on the possibility of group sizes larger than d^alpha. You are right to point this out, and we apologize for confusing group size and d^alpha in our previous comment. In this sense, an interesting question for future work would be to compare the gains in terms of degeneracy in such high-dimensional regimes with polynomial scalings, and group size in our asymptotic-in-n regime, for large groups.\n\nThanks again for your insightful comments.\n\nBest,\nThe authors",

    "review": "I think this paper explores an interesting question, and provides a concrete set of results that demonstrate the possible improvements of exploiting invariance in the kernel design. The extension in section 5 to stability rather than exact invariance also feels important from a practical perspective. Technically, the generalization error bounds in terms of N_{K_G} are perhaps not too surprising, and the more significant technical contributions might be in how to control N_{K_G} and the dimension ratios gamma_d, as carried out in Section 4 and Appendix C.\n\nHowever, the insight provided by this paper also feels (to me) somewhat limited, for the following reasons:\n\n(1) It's not clear how sharp are the obtained generalization bounds---in particular how sharp is the method of bounding N_{K_G} in Lemma 4, and the further restriction of l_n in Theorem 5 such that the second term of this bound dominates the first. I would have appreciated one or two concrete examples where these analyses may be shown to correctly characterize the size of N_{K_G}(lambda) for the relevant choice of lambda.\n\n(2) As the authors recognize, since this dimension ratio nu_d in the risk bound (16) is lower-bounded by 1/|G|, the improvement in generalization error is not in the scaling dependence on n, but rather in how the \"constant\" depends on |G| and the dimension d. Thus the results are more significant for large subgroups or subsets |G|. I think this is fine, but then the analysis in Section 4 is a pointwise analysis over permutations in G, and thus doesn't really track well this dependence on d and |G|. For example, in the bound (17), nu_0 = 1/|G| can indeed be exponentially small in d, but can the leading constant C also be exponentially large in d? If n needs to be exponentially large in d for the statement \"nu_d(l_n) is approximately 1/|G|\" to hold, I think this detracts a bit from the relevance of the results.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA couple other comments:\n\n(3) In the proof of Theorem 13, can the authors perhaps also provide a proof of the analogue of Lemma 3 (the approximation error) in this setting? The result of Lemma 3 feels more intuitive to me in the setting of exact invariance and where S is a projection onto a subspace, but is less clear to me in the \"geometric stability\" setting of Section 5.\n\n(4) Can the authors clarify what is the choice of h(sigma) in Proposition 14",
    "comment": "Thank you for your thorough and detailed review. Our replies follow.\n\n(1) While it may be possible to obtain sharper characterizations of N_{K_G}(lambda) which may jointly exploit decays of the eigenvalues mu_k and the ratios gamma_d(k), we chose to have a simpler upper bound that directly involves N_K(lambda). This allows us to have a final generalization bound that inherits properties of the original kernel while displaying the gains of invariance through nu_d(k), a quantity which we could control more easily, at least asymptotically for large k or n. Nevertheless, a sharper analysis of the degrees of freedom would be a promising direction.\n\n(2) Indeed, the constants in the asymptotic expansions of $\\nu_d(\\ell_n)$ may be large as a function of d, in particular they may depend both on properties of the group (i.e. the number of permutations in the group which have multiplicity leading to the exponent beta), but also on constants that come from the analysis of decay estimates, related to properties of the density q_sigma studied in the proof of Prop. 6. The dependence of these constants on d is thus quite involved, and we are planning to study this more precisely in a longer version of this work. Because of this, it may be easier to interpret our results through an \"asymptotic in n\" lens, where d is fixed and n grows to infinity, as is common in the nonparametric analyses of kernel methods, and here we also rely on such asymptotics for the improvement factor $\\nu_d(\\ell_n)$.\n\n(3) Thank you for pointing this out. In this case, there is not direct analog of Lemma 3, as the approximation error is not the same for the two kernels. We instead rely on the source condition (A5) for the invariant kernel for controlling the approximation error. We note that here the approximation error of the vanilla kernel can also be upper bounded using the same source condition, however the constant $C_{f^*}$ may be smaller in some situations \u2014 we will clarify this point, which was not clear in the current submission.\n\n(4) Thanks for raising this point, we will clarify that h is constant and equal to 1/|G|.",

    "comment": "Thank you for the thorough and encouraging review. We address your comments below.\n\n*Generality, spherical data*. Our setting with data on the sphere was mainly chosen for theoretical convenience, as it is well suited for studying dot-product kernels, and we agree that it may provide a somewhat limited of invariance/stability in general. Establishing similar gains on more general data distributions is an important direction for future work.\n\n*Tightness.* This is a good point. Please see our response to Reviewer BHMR for more on this.\n\n*Exponent in (A2)*. The exponent refers to taking powers of a self-adjoint operator, which corresponds to taking powers of each eigenvalue while keeping eigenvectors fixed. We will clarify this notation in the text.\n\n*Role of group.* The questions of how to go beyond permutations or beyond spherical data are indeed important ones. Regarding the choice of group, we note that our analysis should readily extend to finite subgroups of the orthogonal group, even if this involves transformations that are not permutations. In particular, the dimension and the 1/|G| factor would remain the same in this case. What may change are the asymptotic decays in section 4, which will depend on spectral properties of the transformation matrices involved and may differ from those of permutations. We did not fully grasp the \"quotient\" example you suggested, but we hope this can provide a partial answer, and we are happy to discuss this further.",

    "submission_title": "Topology-Imbalance Learning for Semi-Supervised Node Classification",
    "review": "The topology imbalance problem is very interesting and should be paid more attention. It is clearly illustrated by the authors that labelled nodes at different positions should be weighted differently. Figure 3 is quite impressive that the proposed metric Totoro has strong indication about the position of the labelled nodes and the metric value is directly related with the performance of downstream node classifiers. Overall the presentation is good and I can follow most ideas presented. Specifically, I have following concerns:\n(1) A very important assumption this paper holds is that the decision boundary of Label propagation methods and GNNs methods are aligned. Authors verify this by a visualization in Figure 2(a) but this is very messy and I feel confused about the meaning of the legends (e.g., GCN=T, LP=T).\n(2) Authors empirically proves that nodes with large Totoro values are far away from the decision boundary and should be set large weights during training. Experiment results indeed demonstrate the performance gaining. However, it is still non-intuitive. Samples far away from the decision boundary should be easy cases and contribute less to the classification in many models (refer to SVM). Assigning larger weights to the easy samples is not intuitive for me. Also, the weight computed based on Rank of the Totoro metric is quite heuristic. It is fine but it would be better if authors can point out the direct connection between model performance, specific Totoro values and sample weights.\n(3) The presentation of the core idea from line 120 to line 122 can be improved.  The operation '*' in Eq. (6) and (7) is multiplication? If so try to replace it with other symbols since '*' represents convolution in many cases. Line 198 'GTA' should be 'GAT'. ",
    "comment": "Thanks for your valuable feedback! Here is our response to the concerned questions.\n\n[Q1] Response to question about Figure 2(a):\n\nSorry for this figure make you confused. GCN/LP=T(rue) means the prediction result of GCN/Label Propagation is correct, while GCN/LP=F(alse) means the prediction result of GCN/Label Propagation is wrong. We can find from Figure 2(a) that there is a strong consistency between the prediction results of GCN and LP. Besides, existing work [1] has also proven that LP can be unified with the GCN model theoretically.\n\n[1] Unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation.\n\n\\\n[Q2] Response to question about selecting the 'easy' nodes:\n\nIt is a good question that why we assign more weights to those 'easy' nodes instead of the 'hard' nodes. Different from the SVM model which is mainly used in supervised learning and relies on the 'hard' samples (support vector) to determine the classification boundaries, most message-passing based GNN model (e.g. GCN) applied in the semi-supervised node classification task relies on smoothing the adjacent nodes to transfer the category information from the labeled nodes to the unlabeled nodes [2]. Thus, the 'easy' labeled nodes far away from the class boundaries are expected to better represent class prototypes. Enlarging the training weights of those 'hard' nodes that are close to the class boundaries makes it easier to confuse the class prototype with others. Besides, the labeling size in semi-supervised learning is much smaller than supervised learning (usually 20 nodes per class) and usually, the training nodes are sampled randomly. Hence, a very likely scenario is that the 'hard' samples for some categories are very close to the true class boundaries, while the 'hard' samples for other categories are far away from the true class boundaries. Relying on these 'hard' nodes to decide decision boundaries will cause a large shift of decision boundaries from the true ones. In fact, the labeled nodes close to the boundary of the class edge are the direct cause of topology imbalance according to our analysis in Section 2.\n\n[2] Deeper Insights into Graph Convolutional Networks for Semi-supervised Learning.\n\n\\\n[Q3] Response to question about the weight schedule mechanism:\n\nApart from the proposed loss function, we also try some other weight schedule methods as shown in Appendix B. Overall, our ReNode method has the following advantages: (1) Modifying the training weights of each node enables our method to be combined with most existing GNN encoders and loss functions in a plug-and-play manner and makes it is to follow and extend. Table 1 and Table 3 demonstrate the generalizability of our method; (2) Using the sorting orders instead of the original Totoro values makes the training weight distribution more robust and less susceptible to the outlier nodes; another advantage of sorting strategy lies in that: we can hardly know which nodes are more likely to cause topology imbalance, but we can tell which nodes are better than others and then we can handle different randomly sampled training sets with various degree of topology imbalance; (3) Comparing to the linear decay schedule, the cosine schedule methods pay more attention to nodes with middle-level conflict, distinguishing which is of great importance for reducing topology imbalance. You can refer to Appendix B for more details if you have any interest.\n\n\\\n[Q4] Response to the advice to the paper writing:\n\nThanks for these helpful suggestions, and we will refine them in the revised paper.",

    "comment": "Thanks for your insightful comments on our work! Here is our response to the concerned questions.\n\n[Q1] Response to whether there are existing similar studies.\n\nWe conducted a detailed literature survey before the start of this work. The survey directions include Lable Propagation, GNN, general imbalance learning, and graph-specific imbalance learning. Our work is the first to point out the important topology imbalance problem, and also proposes the first solution for this challenging issue.\n\n\\\n[Q2]Response to the design of the loss function.\n\nApart from the proposed loss function, we also try some other weight schedule methods as shown in Appendix B. Overall, our ReNode method has the following advantages: (1) Modifying the training weights of each node enables our method to be combined with most existing GNN encoders and loss functions in a plug-and-play manner and makes it is to follow and extend. Table 1 and Table 3 demonstrate the generalizability of our method; (2) Using the sorting orders instead of the original Totoro values makes the training weight distribution more robust and less susceptible to the outlier nodes; another advantage of sorting strategy lies in that: we can hardly know which nodes are more likely to cause topology imbalance, but we can tell which nodes are better than others and then we can handle different randomly sampled training sets with various degree of topology imbalance; (3) Comparing to the linear decay schedule, the cosine schedule methods pay more attention to nodes with middle-level conflict, distinguishing which is of great importance for reducing topology imbalance. You can refer to Appendix B for more details if you have any interest. Inevitably, calculating training weights will bring additional computational costs. However, due to the limited size of training nodes, the training weights can be calculated quickly before training. We successfully apply our method in the enormous MAG-Scholar dataset which has more than 10 million nodes as shown in Section 3.4, and the increase in training time is less than 3%. Moreover, there is no method proposed before for the topology-imbalance issue, and our method provides the first solution for the difficult and neglected topology-imbalance issue. The effectiveness of our method is verified in various semi-supervised node classification scenes: TINL-only, TINL & QINL, Large-scale graph, which demonstrates that the topology-imbalance issue is ubiquitous in GNN training, and solving the topology-imbalance issue is a promising direction for improving the related graph tasks.\n\n\\\n[Q3] Response to whether there exist other topology imbalance baselines.\n\nAs stated in the response to Q1, we did not find any methods proposed for solving the topology imbalance issue after a detailed literature survey. Comparing to imbalance learning for general scenes, there are fewer studies related to graph imbalance learning, and all of them focus on the quantity-imbalance issue. We implemented three recently proposed graph quantity-imbalance methods, which encode the topological information and may be helpful for the topology-imbalance issue, but the results in Table 3 show that our proposed method consistently outperforms these three baselines across multiple graph datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our ReNode method.",

    "review": "* **Significance**:  While I like some aspects of the write-up, I find there's some blind spots in the work as it currently stands, which limit its significance:\n\n  *   The proposed method has a strong assumption that the data is homophilous (edges are more likely to link nodes sharing the same label, so clusters of the same label are present in the data).  Should this not hold, all nodes are on the graph's \"class boundary\" (per the Totoro PPR definition).

The authors acknowledge this limitation, but the phenomenon needs to be studied in my opinion.\n\n  *   In both absolute *and* relative terms, the performance gains by applying ReNode for all datasets is actually quite low.  (~1% absolute, ~<2% relative?)  This seems to indicate that ReNode doesn't really address imbalance much better than other proposed approaches (e.g. consider Table 3).  Furthermore it seems like there's no baseline in Table 3 that considers both kinds of imbalance (TINL and QINL)?\n\n  *  There seems to be no study of alternative reweighting strategies to validate the choice of PPR.

    "comment": "Thanks for your detailed comments! Here is our response to the concerned questions.\n\n[Q1] Response to the homophilous assumption.\n\nThe homogeneously connected graphs have numerous application scenarios (such as citation networks, social media, E-shopping\uff0c, etc.) and have attracted enormous studies. Moreover, many extremely influential graph-related studies are based on the research on homogeneously connected graphs (such as GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, PPNP, etc.). In OGB [1], the authors build a new graph benchmark for graph models. For the node classification task, 4 out of the 5 proposed datasets are homogeneously connected, telling the importance and representativeness of the homogeneously connected graphs in the node classification study. Besides, the main intention of this work is to point out the problem of Topology Imbalance, a highly ubiquitous, pernicious but ignored issue in graph scene. In this work, we take the most fundamental semi-supervised node classification scenario with the homophilous assumption as an example to study the topology imbalance. We believe the topology imbalance issue is widespread in other graph tasks with different patterns; how to measure and solve the topology-imbalance issues in broader graph scopes remains a meaningful challenge for the future and the conclusion in this work may inspire future studies.\n\n[1] Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. (Neurips2020)\n\n\\\n[Q2] Response to the improvement gap of ReNode.\n\nOur ReNode method is proposed for handling the topology imbalance issue, which is orthogonal to the existing methods like CB or re-weighting focusing on the quantity imbalance issue. As shown in Table1, even when the training set is quantity-balanced, our ReNode methods can still improve the results of multiple GNN models and graph datasets by relieving topology imbalance. Moreover, as shown in Table 3, our method can be combined with the quantity-imbalance methods to further solve the comprehensive graph imbalance issue. Besides, the random dataset partitioning will bring varying degrees of topology imbalance to the training set. From Table 2, we can find that our method brings larger improvements (absolute>2%) when the topology imbalance level is high.\n\n\\\n[Q3] Response to the lack of the baseline considering TINL and QINL at the same time.\n\nWe conducted a detailed literature survey before the start of this work. The survey directions include Lable Propagation, GNN, general imbalance learning, and graph-specific imbalance learning. Our work is the first to point out the important topology imbalance problem, and also proposes the first solution for this challenging issue. Thus, there are no available baselines considering TINL and QINL at the same time. The effectiveness of our method is verified in various semi-supervised node classification scenes: TINL-only, TINL & QINL, and Large-scale graph, which demonstrates that the topology-imbalance issue is ubiquitous in graph scenes, and solving the topology-imbalance issue is a promising direction for the related graph tasks.\n\n\\\n[Q4] Response to question about the alternative reweighting strategies:\n\nApart from the proposed weight schedule method, we also try some other weight schedule methods as shown in Appendix B. Overall, our ReNode method has the following advantages: (1) Modifying the training weights of each node enables our method to be combined with most existing GNN encoders and loss functions in a plug-and-play manner and makes it is to follow and extend. Table 1 and Table 3 demonstrate the generalizability of our method; (2) Using the sorting orders instead of the original Totoro values makes the training weight distribution more robust and less susceptible to the outlier nodes; another advantage of sorting strategy lies in that: we can hardly know which nodes are more likely to cause topology imbalance, but we can tell which nodes are better than others and then we can handle different randomly sampled training sets with various degree of topology imbalance; (3) Comparing to the linear decay schedule, the cosine schedule methods pay more attention to nodes with middle-level conflict, distinguishing which is of great importance for reducing topology imbalance. You can refer to Appendix B for more details if you have any interest.\n\n\\\n[Q5] Response to how ReNode affects different graph convolutions:\n\nAccording to [2], any GNN models owning the message aggregation, combine, and readout mechanism are as powerful as Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test, including GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, SGC, and so on. Our method works in the readout stage and re-weights the cross-entropy loss (or other loss) of the labeled data. Therefore, although different graph convolutions vary in their message aggregation and combine stages, our ReNode method can release the topology-imbalance issue in the last readout stage. The result is Table 1 verifies the effectiveness of our method in 6 widely used GNN models across 5 benchmark datasets.\n\n[2] How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?\n\n\\\n[Q6] Response to \"how ReNode (and baselines) performed as imbalance was more smoothly varied\"\n\nWe mainly study the combination of TINL and QINL in Table 3. We conclude that when the dataset is severely quantity imbalanced, our method can still effectively alleviate the issue of topology imbalance. Since our work is based on topological imbalance, we did not give more space to the analysis of the quantity imbalanced ratio in the main paper, and we will include this analysis experiment recently. Thanks for this suggestion!\n\n\\\n[Q7] Response to whether the GAT model is tuned well.\n\nWe did carry out a detailed hyperparameters search in the submitted paper. Indeed, for each experiment, the hidden size, dropout probability, learning rate, the lower bound, and the upper bound of the weight schedule are tuned. More details about the hyper-parameters searching can be found in Appendix A. Besides, in our implementation, the GAT model head dimension size is set to (hidden size) / (head number), thus the total model parameter size is similar to other models GCN.\n\n\\\n[Q8] Response to whether there exists a QINL method that helps TINL indirectly.\n\nSo far, all the studies of graph imbalance learning focus on the quantity imbalance issue. We implemented three recently proposed graph quantity-imbalance methods (include GraphSMOTE, which contains an edge generator to conduct re-sampling), which encodes the topological information and may be helpful for the topology-imbalance issue, but the results in Table 3 show that our methods consistently outperform these three methods across multiple graph datasets, demonstrating that these methods proposed for quantity imbalance issue can hardly handle the topology imbalance issue.",

    "review": "All references here can be found in the original paper.\n\n### Originality\nOnline learning with adaptivity constraints has been popular recently, but ideas in this paper does not seem too novel to me. \n-  Under the batch learning model, the LSVI-UCB-Batch algorithm is literally LSVI-UCB with Q-function updates only at pre-specified batch grids. The analysis for the upper bound mostly combines techniques from Jin et al. 2020 (to control the LSVI-UCB estimation quality) and Abbasi-Yadkori et al. 2011 (to control the sum of bonus terms). The message that we can use uniform batch grids is somewhat interesting, but it's quite predictive from Han et al. 2020 that uses uniform batches in SBUCB.\n- Under the rare policy switch model, the LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch uses the determinant based criterion from Abbasi-Yadkori et al. 2011 to determine when to switch the policy. My understanding is that they basically changed the OFUL updates in the rarely switching OFUL algorithm (Abbasi-Yadkori et al. 2011) to LSVI-UCB.  Also, in my opinion, providing a reasonable lower bound in this setting could be the most novel contribution, but unfortunately the authors defer that to future work.\n\n### Quality\nOverall this paper tells a clean and complete story (except missing the lower bound for the rare policy switch model) with all arguments well supported.\n- Theory. I briefly checked the proofs in the appendix (which is generally well-orginized), and the high-level ideas look correct to me.\n- Experiments. It is good to see that the numerical experiments matches what the theory predicts (when the linear MDP assumption holds). It would be good to have some extra experiments showing how the proposed algorithms perform under different levels of model misspecification.\n\n### Clarity\nThe paper is clearly written and well organized. It's very easy to follow, and provides enough information to reproduce experimental results.\n\n### Significance\nRL under adaptivity constraints is a relevant problem in many practices, so I agree that the problem studied here can be valuable. However, as a theoretical paper, its technical contributions look somewhat limited. Also, since the paper assumes linear MDP throughout and it often does not hold in practice, the current experiment results may not be strong enough to convince practitioners that the batch schedules / policy update criterion's work well in practice.",
    "comment": "**Q1**: \u2018It would be good to have some extra experiments showing how the proposed algorithms perform under different levels of model misspecification.\u2019\n\n**A1**: Thank you for the suggestion! We have conducted the following experiments under different levels of model misspecification. In particular, based on the linear MDP constructed in Example 6.1, we follow the definition of $\\zeta$-approximate linear MDPs in [Jin et al. 2020], and consider a corrupted transition given by $\\mathbb{P}_h(s\u2019|0,a) = (1-\\zeta(a))\\phi(0,a)^\\top \\mu_h(s\u2019) + \\zeta(a)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}(s\u2019=g(a))$, where $\\zeta(\\cdot): \\mathcal{A}\\to[0,\\zeta]$ and $g:\\mathcal{A}\\to\\mathcal{S}$. These two additional functions can be constructed by random sampling before running the algorithms, and the magnitude of $\\zeta\\in(0,1)$ characterizes the level of model misspecification. All the other components of the model remain the same. \nUnder this misspecified model with different levels $\\zeta=0.05,0.1,0.2,0.4$, we have run LSVI-UCB-Batch with $B=50$ and LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch with $\\eta=8$ respectively. Our preliminary experiments are presented in the following two tables where we report the average regret at episodes $K=500,1000,1500,2000,2500$ (aggregated over 50 independent rounds):\n\n| LSVI-UCB-Batch, $B=50$ | K=500   | K=1000  | K=1500  | K=2000  | K=2500  |\n| ---------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| $\\zeta=0$              | 1.186 | 0.801 | 0.598 | 0.481 | 0.406 |\n| $\\zeta=0.05$           | 1.230 | 0.851 | 0.643 | 0.522 | 0.441 |\n| $\\zeta=0.1$            | 1.258 | 0.869 | 0.658 | 0.540 | 0.459 |\n| $\\zeta=0.2$            | 1.362 | 1.008 | 0.784 | 0.648 | 0.557 |\n| $\\zeta=0.4$            | 1.565 | 1.255 | 1.016 | 0.865 | 0.766 |\n\nand\n\n| LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch, $\\eta=8$ | K=500   | K=1000  | K=1500  | K=2000  | K=2500  |\n| ----------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| $\\zeta=0$                     | 1.004 | 0.750 | 0.613 | 0.527 | 0.471 |\n| $\\zeta=0.05$                  | 1.068 | 0.828 | 0.684 | 0.592 | 0.531 |\n| $\\zeta=0.1$                   | 1.128 | 0.889 | 0.749 | 0.650 | 0.578 |\n| $\\zeta=0.2$                   | 1.238 | 1.011 | 0.874 | 0.780 | 0.703 |\n| $\\zeta=0.4$                   | 1.447 | 1.258 | 1.143 | 1.064 | 1.002 |\n\nNote that we also include the well-specified model ($\\zeta=0$) which corresponds to the plots we have already shown in the main context. These preliminary results verify the effectiveness of our algorithms under considerable levels of model misspecification. We will conduct more experiments and include corresponding plots in the revision.\n\n---\n\n**Q2**: \u2018technique novelty and contribution\u2019.\n\n**A2**: First, for the batch learning model, when controlling the bonus sum, our proof is simpler than that in Section 3.3 in [Han et al. 2020]. Also, the corresponding analysis for the rare policy switch model shares the same strategy, thus we have proposed a unified framework to conquer adaptivity constraints for UCB-type algorithms in RL. Our analysis is succinct yet generic, and we believe that such ideas can be applied to more general RL settings, e.g., RL with general function approximation [Wang et al. 2020].\n\nMoreover, compared with the bandits problem studied in [Han et al. 2020] and [Abbasi-Yadkori et al. 2011], which is a special case of finite-horizon MDPs with $H=1$, it requires non-trivial effort in terms of the algorithmic design since each stage $h$ can trigger the policy update. One needs to carefully check the dependence structure when applying the martingale concentration inequality, otherwise the argument could easily fail. We believe it is still valuable to generalize the previous works on adaptivity constraints from traditional bandits setting to RL. We take an initial step in this direction for RL with linear function approximation, and we hope this will help advance the community\u2019s knowledge for more complex models.\n\n---\n\n**Q3**: \u2019... provide high-level ideas regarding how to get a lower bound for the rare policy switch model (or some reasonable conjectures of how it should look like)\u2019\n\n**A3**: For the rare policy switch model, we conjecture the regret lower bound to be $\\tilde\\Omega(\\sqrt{d^3H^3T [1+T/(dH)]^{dH/B}})$. We would like to point out that one possible way to establish this kind of lower bound is by adapting the construction of the hard-to-learn instance for stochastic linear bandits proposed in [Ruan et al., 2020]. Yet the problem of this construction is that it requires the action set to be pre-fixed and change from episode to episode, which is not true in the standard linear MDP setting that we consider here. Therefore, we did not include this part due to the mismatch between the assumptions. We will add these remarks in the revision. If the reviewer thinks the lower bound result in a slightly different setting is still helpful, we will include the complete statement and proof of this lower bound in the revision.\n",

    "comment": "**Q1**: \u2018For the LSVI-UVB-RareSwitch, it would be better if you could explain the bound on the adaptivity in terms of $B$ and the role of $B$.\u2019\n\n**A1**: Thank you for your suggestion. We have discussed this in Remarks 5.3 and 5.4.  We will add more discussion on the regret bound of LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch in terms of $B$ in the revision.\n\n---\n\n**Q2**: \u2018When specialized to the tabular setting, the provided regret bounds both scale poorly in $|\\mathcal{S}|,|\\mathcal{A}|$, ..., but it is worth remaking this issue\u2019\n\n**A2**: We agree that if we specialize the linear MDP to tabular MDP using the one-hot feature mapping (see Example 2.1 in [Jin et al. 2020]), then the dependence on $|\\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\\mathcal{A}|$ would be unsatisfactory, yet we think this is caused by the fact that the one-hot feature mapping is not compact enough. In fact, even if specializing the regret bound of (fully adaptive) LSVI-UCB to tabular MDPs, its regret will suffer from the same loose dependence on $|\\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\\mathcal{A}|$. We will comment on this issue in the revision.\n\n---\n\n**Q3**: \u2018In practice, $B$ is often the constraint that is fixed and we are free to choose algorithm parameters, e.g. $T$. It would be useful if you could add comments on how to select algorithm parameters like $T$. What does the PAC bounds look like?\u2019\n\n**A3**: Recall that our regret bound is given by $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{d^3H^3T} + dHT/B)$. If we consider the corresponding PAC bounds, then for any $\\epsilon>0$, it requires that $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{d^3H^3/T} + dH/B) \\leq \\epsilon$, which implies that $T\\geq \\tilde\\Omega(d^3H^3/\\epsilon^2)$ and $B\\geq \\tilde\\Omega(dH/\\epsilon)$. Therefore, to get a meaningful PAC bound, we require both $T$ and $B$ to be sufficiently large. This is reasonable since for a fixed $B$, when $T$ is too large, the dominant term in the regret bounds (both the upper and lower bound) is $dHT/B$ which scales linearly in $T$. We will add these comments in the revision.\n\n---\n\n**Q4**: \u2018Did you try other schemes adjusting $B$ like diminishing $B$ as the learned policy goes to be near-optimal?\u2019\n\n**A4**: This may be a misunderstanding. Note that $B$ is the number of batches rather than the size of each batch.  So diminishing $B$ does not make sense. We guess what you mean is diminishing batch size. This is actually related to our second algorithm LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch, where the number of policy switches is stochastic and the size of each batch is adaptive (depending on the data). Also, by the design of the algorithm, indeed the agent would switch policies less often as the learned policy goes to near-optimal (in this case, the batch size is actually not diminishing, but increasing).\n\n---\n\n**Q5**: \u2018The authors also remark on a similar work [3] that could be a case of their results. It would be helpful for readers to differentiate them if you could add more comments on the technical side.\u2019\n\n**A5**: To compare our work with [Gao et al., 2021], we would like to remark that their main algorithm is a special case of our LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch by setting $\\eta$ to be roughly a constant. Our analysis is more general yet succinct. Moreover, they did not study the batch learning model which we think is also of important practical interest. We will add more detailed comments in the revision as you suggested.\n",

    "comment": "Thanks for your valuable suggestions and comments. Here, we provide detailed responses to your comments.\n\n***Comment 1**: One limitation of the approach is that the documents are split into windows to construct the graphs \u2026 \u2026 It would be nice to see an experiment where this trade off is compared.*\n\n**Response 1**: Actually, our model has involved both the local information (extracted from the neighbor words) and global information (extracted from the whole document), to capture co-occurrences of near words and distant words. As the description shows in Section 3.2.2, we apply graph neural networks to encode each node as the local information and produce the graph-level representation as to the global information by integrating each node following [1]. However, there indeed exists a trade-off about the selection of the window size when constructing document graphs. As the window size increasing, both more semantic correlation and noise would be introduced into our model. Therefore, in Appendix A.5, we have discussed the sensitivity of this hyper-parameter based on one dataset and found that a 5-size window is the best choice. We would add more description about this in the revision.\n\n\n***Comment 2**: Also, the experiments are tested with a window of 5. \u2026 \u2026 However, I could not find a comment on the practical scalability in the paper.*\n\n**Response 2**: Sorry for the confusion. Here, we make it clear that the selection of the window size as 5 is based on the sensitivity analysis in Appendix A.5. Actually, according to our experiments, the window size is not the direct factor to impact the complexity of our model. Instead, the sizes of vocabulary and the word dependency edge set mostly impact the complexity of our model. In recent days, we have run our model on 20NS dataset with different window sizes $s$ by fixing the size of both vocabulary and the word dependency edge set like that in Appendix A.4. The cost time for 100 iterations is 9.1571 seconds for $s=3$, 9.3214 seconds for $s=5$, 9.5142 seconds for $s=7$, and 9.5214 seconds for $s=10$.\n\nIn practice, in order to limit the complexity of our model, we followed other topic models, such as LDA and ProdLDA, and filtered out words and word dependency edges with few frequencies. We have summarized the important dataset statistic after those data preprocessing in Appendix A.4, including the sizes of vocabulary and word dependency edge set used in our practical experiments. In particular, we found that our model can achieve a better trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in most datasets, when constraining the size of the dependency edge set is about three times that of vocabulary.\n\n***Comment 3**: In terms of topic diversity, the results show that \u2026 \u2026 on the results would be beneficial to understand this.*\n\n**Response 3**: Sorry for the confusion. Indeed, as the number of topics increases, topic models prefer to capture similar topics. As a result, the topic diversity of most models in our experiments is reduced when increasing the number of topics. As for the special phenomenon about LDA, it may be because LDA prefers to capture several different but meaningless topics. To be specific, we follow [2] and define topic diversity (TD) as the percentage of unique words in the top words. However, TD cannot measure the interpretability of topics independently. Sometimes, topic models can learn several meaningless topics with top words semantically uncorrelated, but top words of different topics are different from each other. In this case, we cannot claim that the model is equipped with high interpretability, although the TD score is high. In contrast, we must consider both topic coherence metrics and topic diversity metric to measure the interpretability of topic models, where TC measure the average interpretability in each topic and TD measures the diversity among different topics. In our experiments, LDA has captured a great TD score. However, the TC score is lower than our model and some other baselines, especially based on NPMI metric, which matches human judgment most closely [3]. In other words, LDA prefers to capture several different but meaningless topics. We would provide more explanation in the revision about this interesting phenomenon.\n\n[1] Li, Yujia, et al.

    "comment": "Thanks very much for your positive comments about our paper and valuable suggestions. First, as per your suggestion, we would like to explore the sensitivity of the window size parameter based on more datasets and the impact of word embedding used on the performances of our model in the future work. We believe that those explorations can help us to enhance the evaluation experiments and inspire us to improve the design of our model. Meanwhile, we are sorry for our unclear description, grammatical error, and some typos. We would improve our presentation and written carefully.

Specifically, we use the stop word list same as that in genism package, which is a well-known python package for topic modeling and text processing. The frequency threshold to filter out low-frequency words is set as 20 for 20NS, 5 for TMN, 120 for BNC, and 10 for Reuters. The frequency threshold to filter out low-frequency dependency edges is set as 10 for 20NG, 3 for TMN, 40 for BNC, and 15 for Reuters. \n\n\n***Comment 3**: 2.2 : there should be a way to simplify the notation, this subsection is hard to follow.

    "comment": "Thanks for your valuable comments. Here, we provide detailed responses to each of your comments.\n\n***Comment 1**: Representing each document as a directed word graph is interesting, \u2026 \u2026 Further clarity is needed here.*\n\n**Response 1**: Thanks for your positive comments. Sorry for the confusion about the description of notations. In our paper, for each document $d$, we denote the document graph as $G_d=(V_d, E_d)$, where $V_d=[w_{d,1}, \u2026, w_{d,N_d}]$ is the word set and $E_d$ is the set of word edges. As for the example in Figure 1(a), $V_d$ is a set of 7 words, i.e, $w_{d,1}=$latent, $w_{d,2}=$dirichlet, \u2026, $w_{d,7}=$documents. $E_d$ is a set of 11 word edges, i.e., $\\\\{$(latent, dirichlet), (latent, allocation),\u2026, (topics, documents) $\\\\}$. We denote $G^o_d=(V^o_d,E^o_d)$ as the graph structure of $G_d$ with anonymous nodes. The placeholder set $V^o_d$ only includes the position assignments of each word, such as $\\\\{1,2,\u2026.,7\\\\}$ for the same example in Figure 1(a). The placeholder edge set $E_d^o$ is the edge set between position assignments, such as $\\\\{$(1,2), (1,3), \u2026, (6,7)$\\\\}$ for the same example. In other words, $G^o_d$ can be specified solely by the edge set $E^o_d$ when giving the number of words. However, $G_d$ is dominated by the tuple of both $G^o_d$ and $V_d$. \n\nAlong this line, as the description shows in section 3.1 and Algorithm 2 in Appendix, we need to generate those two observed data successively, $G^o_d$ and $V_d$, to construct the document graph $G_d$ in the generative story. Equation (4) aims to model the conditional probability of the graph structure, i.e, $G^o_d$, given the topic assignment set $z_{d,n}$ in each position $n$. This process is about deciding if there is a directed edge between two placeholders, with specific topic assignments, not words. To be specific, we denote the adjacent matrix of $G_d^o$ as $A^o_d$. Inspired by [4], we formulate $p(G^o_d|Z_d;M)$ as following:\n\n$p(G^o_d|Z_d;M) = p(E_d^o|Z_d;M)= p(A^o_d|Z_d;M) = \\prod_{i=1}^N\\prod_{j=1}^N p(A^o_{d,ij}|z_{d,i},z_{d,j};M),$\n\nwhere $p(A^o_{d,ij}=1|z_i,z_j) = m_{z_i,z_j}$, $M\\in \\mathbb{R}^{K\\times K}$ is the dependency matrix among topics and each element $m_{i,j} \\in [0,1]$ represents the possibility that there exists a dependency edge between two placeholders with topic $i$ and $j$. Then, we can obtain Equation (4) after simple derivations. In the revision, we would provide more descriptions to explain our notations.\n\n***Comment 2**: In the proposed model, each topic is also a distribution over edges between pairs of words \u2026 \u2026 if the topic assignment to edges is independent of the topic assigned to a word, or they are dependent.*\n\n**Response 2**: Sorry for the confusion. Our model infers the topic assignment only for each word, not for word dependency edges. The hidden idea is that the topic assignments of all placeholders in the document graph should indicate both the dependency relation between different placeholders and the specific words on those positions. Along this line, as the description shows in section 3.1 and Algorithm 2 in Appendix, we need to generate those two observed data successively, $G^o_d$ and $V_d$, to construct the document graph $G_d$ based on the topic assignments $Z_d$ of all placeholders. In particular, as the description shows in Section 3.1.2, when generating word set $V_d$ given both topic assignments $Z_d$ and graph structure $G^o_d$, we assume that the words on the placeholders with the same topics are dependent mutually if there exist edges among those placeholders. Based on this assumption, we introduce the distribution on word edges into topics to model those dependency relations and design a legal probabilistic measure on the vocabulary $V$ to model the generation of $V_d$, i.e., Equation (5).\n\n***Comment 3**: In regards to the topic coherence scores, \u2026 \u2026 reporting how documents are preprocessed is necessary.*\n\n**Response 3**: Thanks for your valuable comments. For all datasets, we filtered out the stop words and words with low frequency. Appendix A.4 has shown the important data statistics after data preprocessing. When computing the topic coherence score, similar to [5], we regarded all documents after data preprocessing in the corresponding original dataset as the reference corpus.\n\n***Comment 4**: There is a lack of oblation study on the impact of representing topics as a distribution over edges.*\n\n**Response 4**: As your suggestion, we have conducted the oblation study by removing the distribution over edges from topics, namely GNTM w/o $\\beta^e$. To be specific, different from the description in Section 3.1.2, we assume that words are independent form each other given the topic assignments $Z_d$. In other words, different from Equation (6), we formulate $P(V_d|Z_d, G_d^o)$ as:\n\n$p(V_d|Z_d,G_d^o;\\beta^v) = \\prod_{n=1}^{N_d} \\beta^v_{z_{d,n}, w_{d,n}}. $\n\nThen, we can re-derive the loss function based on Equation (9). The experiment results on 20NG dataset in the following table show that removing the distribution over edges from topics causes the decrease of interpretability of topics.\n\n|Num. of topics|20|30|50|70|100|\n|  ----  | ----  |----  |----  |----  |----  |\n|*The performance of NPMI with top 10 words*|\n|GNTM|0.1235|0.1074|0.0807|0.0710|0.0587|\n|GNTM w/o $\\beta^e$|0.0994|0.0953|0.0791|0.0701|0.0386|\n|*The performance of $C_v$ with top 10 words*|\n|GNTM|0.6962|0.6605|0.6328|0.6222|0.5939|\n|GNTM w/o $\\beta^e$|0.6479 |0.6445 |0.6055 |0.5924 |0.5532 |\n|*The performance of topic diversity with top 10 words*|\n|GNTM|0.9110|0.8759|0.8352|0.7231|0.5530|\n|GNTM w/o $\\beta^e$|0.9000 |0.9000 |0.7700 |0.4900 |0.3700|\n\n***Comment 5**: Besides GraphBTM, it might also be good to consider those GCN based topic models, like [1-3].*\n\n**Response 5**: Thanks for your valuable comments. We would like to introduce more GCN based topic models in the revision to improve our model evaluation. \n\n\n***Comment 6**: it is good to show how sensitive the model is to the window size used in construction G_d.*\n\n**Response 6**: Thanks for your comments. Indeed, in Appendix A.5, we have conducted several analyses about the sensitivity of the window size. The results show 5-size window is the best choice.

In particular, the algorithm clearly outperforms CoreSet, BADGE, Margin and Random on the Open Images dataset. The algorithm requires 29% less labels than the second-best model in the 100k batch-size setting and 60% less labels in the 1M batch-size setting to achieve the same result (mAP). Cluster-Margin also outperforms all other methods on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and obtains a similar performance on SVHN. \n    \n    The authors also establish a theoretical guarantee for the Cluster-MarginV algorithm and show that those results hold for the Cluster-Margin algorithm in specific settings. In particular, they show that the Cluster-MarginV algorithm has a label complexity bound which improves over the Margin algorithm by a factor beta. They also show that this improvement is possible, under specific hypotheses like an optimal volume-based sampler, when the dimensionality of the embedding space is small or when the batch size k is large. They also show that the optimal volume-based sampler is approximately equivalent to the Cluster-Margin algorithm. They finally show that log(k) is an upper bound on the improvement of query complexity for any sampler. \n    The authors are aware and mention that their theoretical results are initial and that equating volume based samplers and the Cluster-Margin algorithm is an open research question. \n    \n    Clarity: \n    The paper is very clear and well organized. The authors detail the hyper-parameters and compute details used for the experiments. The Cluster-Margin algorithm is also explained in detail.  \n    \n    Significance: \n    The results are important as the algorithm allows for more efficient and effective large-batch-size active learning compared to existing methods.

Here are my comments: In regards to the topic coherence scores, it is not unknown that consistent document preprocessing can significantly affect the topic coherence scores, reporting how documents are preprocessed is necessary. There is a lack of oblation study on the impact of representing topics as a distribution over edges. Besides GraphBTM, it might also be good to consider those GCN based topic models, like [1-3]. It is good to show how sensitive the model is to the window size used in construction G_d."

    "comment": "Thanks for your valuable comments! Here, we provide detailed responses to each of your review comments.

As the description in Introduction, most of them focus on enhancing language modeling with topic models. However, different from these works, we focus on improving the interpretability of topic models. To our best knowledge, we are the first to present a topic as a graph and introduce the distribution over word dependency edges to the concept of topics, which helps to improve the interpretability of topics.\n\n***Comment2**: comparison to the baselines methods used is not fair and incomplete \u2026 \u2026 for fair comparison.*\n\n**Response 2**: Actually, in our experiments, the state-of-the-art baseline, ETM [7] (TACL 2020), is a representation of topic models based on pre-trained word embedding. In recent days, we also reproduced iDocNADEe [6] (AAAI 2019) on 20NS dataset, and the results in the above table show that our model also outperforms this baseline. Note that iDocNADEe constrains the equality of the dimension of word embedding and the number of topics. We can only set the number of topics as 50 and 100, due to the lack of pretraining word-embedding with other dimensions in public. We also tried to reproduce GaussianLDA [4]. However, the model is highly time-costing if there is a large vocabulary size. We cannot report the result due to the limitation of time. In the revision, we would explore this baseline and the models in [2], or other comparative baselines.\n\n***Comment 3**: missing comparison with the topic models that incorporates word dependency relations such as [1, 2, 3]*\n\n**Response 3**: In recent days, we reproduced TopicRNN [2] as the representation of models you proposed incorporating word dependency relations. The results in the above table show that it is not competitive. Moreover, in this paper, we have implemented the GraphBTM [9] model as another comparison, which models word dependency in a graph manner. \n\n***Comment 4**: experimental setup is unclear; how are the scores of baseline methods obtained?*\n\n**Response 4**: Sorry for the confusion. In our experiments, all baselines are implemented carefully with the guidance of their official code, and the code links can be found in Appendix A.5. Our code will be publicly available after the acceptance of this paper. Without specific description, the parameters of baselines are the same as those recommended by the original paper. To ensure a fair comparison, the vocabulary of our model and all baselines are the same, and the metric scores, i.e., NPMI, $C_v$, TD, Purity, and NMI, are computed based on the same strategies for all models. We would provide more descriptions on the experimental setup in the revision.\n\n***Comment 5**: Additional experiments are required to evaluate the quality of document representations such as text classification and unsupervised IR.*\n\n**Response 5**: In this paper, the main goal is to improve the interpretability of topic models with topic coherence and topic diversity as our main metrics. We would further extend our models for other downstream tasks in the future.\n\n***Comment 6**: DocNADE and its variants such as iDocNADE/iDocNADEe have shown to outperform [3] ProdLDA; however the score of iDocNADE are low. Please provide experimental details and reasoning on the deviation of scores from original works?*\n\n**Response 6**: Sorry for the confusion. In [3], the authors showed that DocNADE and its variants could achieve better performance based on $C_v$ metric. However, they conducted experiments based on full documents for language modeling without reduced vocabulary setting, i.e., removing the stop words and few frequency words. In contrast, we followed LDA and ProdLDA [10] and conducted our experiments with the reduced vocabulary setting, where our model and all baselines require the reduced vocabulary to improve interpretability. I have checked our code to ensure the correctness of our results. Our code will also be publicly available after possible publication. Meanwhile, we found that the sentence \u201cNPMI over (50/200) topics learned on 20NS by: ProdLDA (.24/.19) and DocNADE (.15/.12) in RV (reduced vocabulary) setting\u201d at the footnote of Page 7 in [3]. In other words, DocNADE cannot outperform ProdLDA based on NPMI metrics with reduced vocabulary, same as the results in our experiments.\n\n***Comment 7**: The proposed GNTM model incorporates word dependency relations\u2026 \u2026 required for completeness.*\n\n**Response 7**: Thanks for your valuable comments. In recent days, we have reproduced TopicRNN [2] as the representation of the models you proposed. The results in the above table show that this model is not competitive. Actually, in our experiments, the baseline, GraphBTM [9], is one representation with graph-based word dependency. We would explore other types of word dependency, such as syntactic or contextualized word dependency, in future work. \n\n[1] Wang, Tong, et al. Extended topic model for word dependency.

    "submission_title": "Self-Attention Between Datapoints: Going Beyond Individual Input-Output Pairs in Deep Learning",
    "review": "Strengths:\n\n- The paper reaches very good results in tabular datasets. They reach the best results in 4 out of 10 datasets, better than any other method. When separated into the three main tasks: binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression, they reach the best results in binary classification, joined best results in multi-class classification, and joined second-best results in regression. Overall, it can be considered that the method works at least on par (in my opinion, slightly better) than the two main gradient boosting methods: XGBoost and CatBoost.\n\n- Understanding the method is quite straightforward, the authors do a good job at explaining it.\n\n- The authors do a good job at giving insights after they present their method.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1) Massively overstated claim. The first sentence of the paper 'We challenge a common assumption underlying most supervised deep learning: that a model makes a prediction depending only on its parameters and the features of a single input.' gives the impression that this is the first paper that tries to model some sort of relation between the data, instead of input-output relation which is commonly done in deep learning. However, this is a very misleading statement, contextual relations between the data in neural networks have been going on at least since RNNs were invented. More interestingly, there are entire fields in deep learning whose sole purpose is to model the relations between the data. Those fields fall under the umbrella of similarity learning, and are specialized in different directions like metric learning, person re-identification, face recognition etc.\n\nIn all those fields, the idea is that the embedding/results of a data point are not dependent only on itself, but also on the other data points. Typically that was done using some sort of contrastive/triplet loss, but nowadays that is done by using the relations between all the pairs in the dataset. That could be done as some sort of ranking, proxy, or contextual procedure. For example:\n\n[A] Wang et al., Ranked List Loss for Deep Metric Learning, CVPR 2019 (Ranking)\n\n[B] Movshovitz-Attias et al., No Fuss Distance Metric Learning using Proxies, ICCV 2017 (Proxy)\n\n[C] Kim et al., Proxy Anchor Loss for Deep Metric Learning, CVPR 2020 (Proxy)\n\n[D] Elezi et al., The Group Loss for Deep Metric Learning, ECCV 2020 (Contextual)\n\n[E] Bao et al., Masked Graph Attention Network for Person Re-identification, CVPRW2019 (Contextual)\n\n[F] Seidenschwarz et al., Learning Intra-Batch Connections for Deep Metric Learning, ICML 2021 (Contextual)\n\nTake a look especially on papers [E, F]. They are doing almost the same thing as this paper, a rewriting of the GAT paper [G] to solve some other task. [F] specifically mentions that they use Transformers to model the relations between the samples in the dataset, which is the same thing as this paper.\n\n[G] Velickovic et al., Graph Attention Networks, ICLR 2018.\n\nYet, this is not discussed at all in this paper (although [G] has been cited, but not properly discussed). In many ways, the paper is not doing anything more than these other papers, making the claim massively exaggerated. \n\n2) Misleading statement - \n\nline 62-63: We provide the model with the entire dataset \u2013 all datapoints \u2013 as input.\nline 72: NPTs take as input the entire dataset $X \\in R^{n\u00d7d}$.\n\nMy first impression was how is this scalable, and I was expecting a sophisticated way of somehow memorizing the dataset or using some hashing procedure that allows that. To my disappointment, it quickly became clear that the authors, in fact, do not use the entire dataset. Instead, they use minibatches of the dataset (lines 173-179), something that is done in virtually every other deep learning paper (including the ones I mentioned above).\n\n3) Very poor results in CIFAR10/MNIST: I was initially disappointed that when it comes to image datasets, the method is tested only in very simple and long-outdated datasets, like MNIST and CIFAR-10. I would have expected that 'a general framework' that goes 'beyond deep learning' would actually do some more realistic evaluations in more complicated datasets. However, I was even more disappointed to see the results in CIFAR10, where the method reaches only 68.2%. CIFAR10 is a dataset where SOTA is over 99.5% reached by a method that uses Transformers [H]. Even compared to only non-parametric methods (which the method claims to be, although it is a mix between parametric and non-parametric), the results in other works are considerably better (75.89% [I]). Similarly, the method reaches only 98.3% accuracy in MNIST, way below other papers that reach 99.8% (including more than a decade old work of [J]) or the non-parametric method of [I] that reaches 99.44%.\n\n[H] Dosovitskiy et al., An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale, ICLR 2021\n\n[I] Blomqvist et al., Deep Convolutional Gaussian Processes, ECML-PKDD 2019\n\n[J] Cire\u015fan et al., Multi-column Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification, CVPR 2012\n\nVerdict: If the paper would have been presented for what it is: a paper that combines ideas from other fields to progress the task of classification/regression in tabular datasets, this paper would have been an interesting one, and probably deserving of getting published at NeurIPS. However, the claims of the paper are massively exaggerated, the related work does not mention other papers that roughly do the same thing (in more complicated tasks), making the abstract, introduction, and conclusions completely misleading. Adding to that, the weak results in image datasets, I do not see the paper being fit for publishing at the NeurIPS conference. My low score is quite heavily weighted towards the misleading parts of the paper and it promising far more than it shows.\n\n**Update:** Please see the response to rebuttal for the updated version of the review, and why I changed my original score.\n",
    "comment": "Dear reviewer bbzv,\n\nWe sincerely thank you for your hard work and helpful feedback.\nWe ask that you read our comment above, addressed to all reviewers, first.\nBelow we address your specific comments as best as we can, and we hope you will engage with us actively during the discussion period to clarify any remaining points.\n\n## 1. Contributions of NPT\n\n### NPTs Are Not Metric Learning\n\nWe think there has been a misunderstanding: there are major differences between our approach and the related work [A-G] you cite.\n(In the following, we will refer to [A-F] as \u2018metric learning\u2019 for convenience.)\nIn particular, metric learning does not include learned interactions between training and test data at *test prediction time*, which is a core contribution of our approach \u2013 non-parametric predictions *through explicit modelling of interactions between training points and test points*.\nNote that we here refer to training and test data being taken *jointly as input* to the neural network model *at test time* ($f_\\theta(\\mathcal{D}_\\text{train}, \\mathcal{D}_\\text{test})$), in contrast to *independent embeddings* of datapoints being used at test time in metric learning ($f_\\theta(x_\\text{test})$, e.g., with $\\theta$ the optimum of a triplet loss or other).\n\n> gives the impression that this is the first paper that tries to model some sort of relation between the data\n\nWe regret that we conveyed this impression and commit to fixing this in a future draft.\nNote that in our introduction, related work section (in S.3 and Appendix D), and conclusion we cite an extensive list of literature that does model relations between or within data points such as (Deep) Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernel Learning, Neural Processes, Axial Transformers, MSA Transformers, GCN, GAT, GIN, and Neural Relational Inference (see paper for references).\n\nNevertheless, we stand by our claim in the first sentence that non-parametric prediction \u2013 that is, prediction in explicit dependence on training data at test time \u2013 is generally uncommon in supervised deep learning settings.\n\nWe hope that you engage with us to further discuss similarities and differences of the above approaches with NPTs during the discussion period, and we give some more detailed thoughts on metric learning below.\n\n### Detailed Comments on the Suggested Related Work\n\nThank you for suggesting references [A-G].\nWe are happy to add a detailed discussion of metric learning/person re-identification to our related work section, and to extend the discussion of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).\nIn particular, we agree that papers [E-G] are important related work through their use of GNNs.\n\nIn [A-D], datapoints interact *only during training* and *only through the loss function*, which is defined on multiple samples and encourages the learning of useful representations.\nAt test time, the CNN is applied *independently* to the samples, such that these approaches do not leverage *learned interactions* at test time \u2013 only a fixed procedure using the datapoint embeddings. \n\nThis is in stark contrast to NPTs, which explicitly perform self-attention between training features, training targets, and test features at *test* time.\nThis allows NPTs to learn to perform operations such as test-time lookup between training and test inputs.\nFor example, NPTs can learn to copy the targets of training points with matching features to the test target.\nThis is demonstrated by the semi-synthetic experiments in the paper, especially the intervention experiments in S. 4.2 and extensions in Appendix B.1.2, where we complicate the task further such that it cannot be solved by Gaussian Processes/k-NN (or metric learning).\nNone of the suggested related work [A-G] can learn to perform such operations, because they do not consider learned interactions between training and test points at test time and/or do not take training targets as inputs.\n\nApproaches [E-F] apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) between samples after embedding datapoints independently.\nHowever, the most obvious difference to NPTs here is that [E] throws away the GNN after training.\nThe GNN only serves to improve the embeddings of the CNN, and at test time, again only the CNN is used, which does not use learned relations between inputs at test time.\nTherefore, at test time [E] is identical in spirit to [A-D] and distinctly different to NPTs.\n\nThis is also the main modus operandi for [F].\nHowever, in their appendix, [F] does explore the targeted construction of test-batches, which to some extent *could* allow them to do things similar to NPTs.\nEven then, unlike NPTs, they explicitly do not include training features in the test-batches, and cannot include training targets (because the architecture does not allow for it).\nNote that taking (known) targets as input to the model at test time is key to some of the intriguing properties of NPT, such as those demonstrated with the semi-synthetic experiments discussed above.\nWe further found that our stochastic target masking, which encourages use of input training targets at test time, was indeed beneficial to NPT performance on small data (Appendix C.1.2).\nApart from being distinct from our work and solving a different problem, we also note that *[F] was published* at ICML 2021, in July, which is significantly *after the NeurIPS submission deadline*.\n\n### Summary\n\nNPTs use self-attention between training and test datapoints (features and targets) to compute predictions in a non-parametric fashion.\nIn contrast, \u201cthe objective of deep metric learning (DML) is to learn embeddings that can capture semantic similarity and dissimilarity information among data points\u201d \u2013 as is stated in the reference [A].\nWe believe that the goals and methods of metric learning and NPTs therefore are distinct.\nWe value your opinion, and ultimately hope to resolve any misunderstanding.\nTherefore, we hope to engage with you in the discussion period.\nParticularly, we would be open to a discussion on how we can adjust the paper to avoid further misunderstanding, e.g., by making the first sentence in our abstract clearer or by emphasizing how our learned train-test-interactions at test time are distinctly different from metric learning.\n\n## 2. Minibatch Approximation\n\nThank you for drawing our attention to this. There may be a misunderstanding here.\nIn fact, we use the minibatch approximation *only* if the full dataset does not fit into memory.\nIn 4/10 of our tabular datasets, we do indeed use the full dataset *without requiring minibatches* (see Tables 11 and 12 in the Appendix).\nWe regret that l. 62 was perceived as misleading.\nHowever, we note that on l. 65, directly afterwards, we clarify that \u201cwe approximate this where necessary for large data (S. 2.6)\u201d.\nIn S. 2.6 (ls. 173-179) and S. 5 we then address the scaling limitations of NPTs for larger datasets explicitly.\nWe will revise the draft to mention \u201cminibatches\u201d explicitly in l. 65 (or earlier) to make this immediately clear for future readers.\n\n> they use minibatches of the dataset (lines 173-179), something that is done in virtually every other deep learning paper \n\nWhile that is true, we stress that the importance of our approach is that we perform attention *between* inputs of the minibatch, including both features and (some) labels at training and test time.\nFor us, minibatches are an approximation to the full dataset and not a way of parallelizing model training/prediction.\nScaling an NPT-like model to take as input a large-scale dataset, followed by a \u201csophisticated\u201d embedding or memorization as you mention, is important and interesting follow-up work. We point towards this in ls. 352-353 when describing \u201cfuture work in principled attention approximations, such as learning representative input points, kernelization, or other sparsity-inducing methods\u201d.\n\n## 3. Results for CIFAR-10\n\nThe importance of the CIFAR-10 and MNIST results is to demonstrate that NPT makes use of interactions between datapoints even for the image datasets (S. 4.3/Table 2).\nOur intention was not to claim that the results we get are competitive with state-of-the-art image-classification methods.\nIn Appendix B.6, our submission includes a discussion of our setup for image data.\nIn particular, we explain why we should not be expected to achieve the same results as the study [H] you cite.\nAmong these reasons, we mention that such previous works obtain 90%+ accuracy on images with Transformers by pretraining on \u201clarge or huge datasets; for example, ImageNet [22,39,74], ImageNet-21k [65], or JFT-300M, with over 375 million labeled datapoints\u201d.\nThey also \u201cuse significantly more patches (e.g., 256 in [24]) and use higher resolutions, including during fine-tuning by upscaling\u201d. \nAdditionally, please see our comment addressing all reviewers for new and improved results on the image datasets using a CNN encoder.\n\nWe hope that our response and the new ablations have adequately addressed what we believe is largely a misunderstanding.\nWe would greatly appreciate engaging you during the discussion period to talk through any remaining misunderstandings and make changes necessary for you to no longer view the paper as misleading and instead fitting for publication at NeurIPS.\n\nThank you,\n\nThe Authors",

We will add this to the paper!\nNote that the purpose of our \u201cearly results\u201d on images was to show that NPTs continue to rely on interactions between datapoints even for images (S. 4.3/Table 2).\nHowever, we have now updated and significantly improved the results on the image data following suggestions from [m1rj].\nWe give those results in the main comment addressed to all reviewers.\n\n## Embeddings in Appendix C.3\n\nThanks for the insight that Appendix C.3 was very informative to you.\nWe will happily move C.3 to the main text.\n\n## No Feature Masking\n\nDisabling feature masking is an interesting idea!\nIn general, we would expect feature masking during training to be a meaningful regularizer for \u201ceasy\u201d datasets, by making the prediction task more difficult and guarding against memorization.\nA quick clarification: are you suggesting we set $\\lambda=0$ (l. 160) but keep $p_\\text{feature}=0.15$ (l. 154), i.e. we continue to mask out features but do not backpropagate any losses (resulting in a dropout-like operation on the input)?\nWe speculate you might instead prefer us to set $\\lambda=0$ *and* $p_\\text{feature}=0$, such that there is no feature masking on the input anymore.\nWe have performed this ablation and give results in the main comment addressed to all reviewers.\n(We hope that this is your intention, and would be happy to discuss adding additional ablations if we have misinterpreted your intention).\n\nWe hope that our response and the new ablations have adequately addressed your concerns.\nWe would greatly appreciate it if you could engage with us during the discussion period on any remaining barriers to raising your score and confidence.\n\nThank you,\n\nThe Authors",

    "review": "This is a high-quality paper that is exceptionally well-written, well-structured and very clear in its exposition. The idea is novel and well-positioned against related work (with some exceptions). I think that this paper is relevant for the NeurIPS community and I expect that it will inspire a range of follow-up works.\n\nThe idea of using self-attention to take into account all other data points (including their labels, if available) both during training and inference is intriguing, and given the rising popularity Transformer-style architectures in the machine learning community, I expect that this method will spawn lots of interest despite its shortcomings in its current form, such as its computational complexity and its limited usefulness/applicability in any of the studied tasks in the paper.\n\nThe experimental evaluation is carried out with great care and the authors come up with several insightful experiments to study whether the attention between datapoint (ABD) mechanism learns to make use of features/labels of similar data points.\n\nOverall, I think that this paper can be accepted and that it would make a great addition to the conference program. I do, however, want to highlight several limitations of the method and issues with the paper below, which I encourage the authors to take into account in the next version of the paper.\n\nThe core contribution of the paper is the attention between datapoint (ABD) mechanism and its application for semi-supervised learning in tabular data. While the other model contribution, namely attention between attributes (ABA) is interesting, it is not properly experimentally evaluated (e.g. against an alternative, simpler architecture component, such as an MLP on the flattened representation, or simply the identity, i.e. no module at all). The reader might wonder why this module is introduced in the first place, and its necessity is unclear. I could imagine that this module could simply be left out for the tabular tasks without affecting performance in a significant way. For the visual task, it could likely be replaced with a CNN encoder as the Embedding function (Figure 2b), as done in prior work [1], which would reduce computational complexity and likely not hurt performance. I encourage the authors to revisit the choice of why ABA is introduced in the first place.\n\nOne core limitation of the method is its computational complexity. The authors highlight strongly competitive results on tabular data, but this only takes into account the validation error / accuracy. I strongly suspect that the proposed method is by far not competitive with the shown baselines when taking into account computation time and memory requirement. These limitations should be highlighted in the main paper (not in the appendix) by showing a direct comparison in terms of wall clock training/inference time (and memory) to give researchers and practitioners a clear picture about the practicality of the technique. I agree with the authors that alleviating this limitation is a promising avenue for future work.\n\nIn terms of related work, I encourage the authors to use the additional page for the camera-ready version (should the paper be accepted) to include the discussion on graph-based semi-supervised learning using graph neural networks in the main paper (instead of the appendix), as the closest relatives to the proposed model come from this research area. This includes a highly-cited paper [1] which similarly introduces an attention mechanism that  aggregates information across data points for semi-supervised learning and few-shot learning in an architecture that is closely related to the one presented here. This paper is currently not cited/discussed, but I think it should be closely contrasted against the proposed technique.\n\nOther suggestions for improvement:\n* The CIFAR-10 and MNIST results are currently very difficult to interpret in the absence of any baselines. A comparison against a variant of the model that does not use attention between data points (in the main paper) would significantly strengthen this section.\n* The statement that \"they can learn to completely ignore other inputs, essentially collapsing into a standard parametric model\", in the context of perturbed features (Section 4.3) should be verified, e.g. by comparing the attention weights with and without perturbation of the features.\n\n[1] Garcia & Bruna, Few-Shot Learning with Graph Neural Networks (ICLR 2018)\n",
    "comment": "Dear reviewer m1rj,\n\nWe sincerely thank you for your hard work and helpful feedback.\nWe ask that you read our comment above, addressed to all reviewers, first.\nBelow we address your specific comments as best as we can, and we hope you will engage with us actively during the discussion period to clarify any remaining points.\n\n## MLP instead of ABA \n\nThank you for suggesting the ablations!\nIn general, we believe that ABA should be a fairly robust and general component of the NPT model that is somewhat well motivated by the desire to learn complex representations (ls. 145-147).\nHowever, you are absolutely right; practically, an MLP on the flattened representation might suffice \u2013 especially on tabular data.\nFollowing your suggestion, we have performed an ablation of NPT without ABA layers, such that only the MLP at the end of ABD can transform features (the \u2018rFF\u2019 in Eq. 4).\nWe give results in our main comment addressed to all reviewers.\n\n## CNN Encoder\n\nReplacing our linear patching with a CNN encoder for the image data is a great idea!\nWe have also performed this ablation and give results in the main thread to all reviewers.\n\n## Computational Complexity\n\nWe agree that it is useful to extend the discussion on computational complexities and plan to give explicit comparisons in terms of training times, memory requirements, and prediction speed of NPT vs. baselines in the main body of the paper.\n\nAs of now, NPT does generally require longer training times than the non-neural baselines.\nFor example, for the Protein dataset, our current NPT implementation trains in 11 hours, while all boosting methods finish their runs in less than 1 hour including the hyperparameter tuning.\nThe exception to this rule is given by some of the baselines (e.g. random forests) which seem to not scale well to large datasets such as Higgs Boson, which is our largest dataset at 11 million datapoints.\nOn Higgs, the NPT run takes 142 h compared to 325 h for random forests.\n\nIn terms of memory at prediction time, we suspect that NPT is indeed much more memory-intensive than the baselines, as we try to store as much data as possible in addition to the network weights.\n\nIn terms of prediction speed, we suspect that our ability to scale NPT to large batch sizes (e.g., 4096 on the Higgs dataset) might give us an advantage in comparison to those baselines that cannot be parallelized well and/or lack GPU support.\n\nNote that these numbers are to just give a rough indication since we did _not_ optimize the baselines or NPT for memory, training time, or prediction speed. Additionally, comparisons between the CPU-only baselines implemented in C++ and GPU-accelerated PyTorch models will also depend on our specific CPU/GPU choices. Further, by incorporating recent tools for scaling attention, we expect future research to significantly improve on these rough numbers.\n\nWe look forward to your feedback and plan to add an extended discussion of the above points.\n\n## Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) Discussion in Main Text\n\nThis is a great suggestion \u2013 thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will move the GNN discussion to the main body of the paper, as well as extend the discussion with additional related work including [1].\n\n## Collapse to Parametric Model\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention.\nS.4.3 is a crucial point in the paper, in which we perturb (we call it \u2018corrupt\u2019) the features of all other datapoints in the input.\nThis allows us to study if the prediction changes at any given input row if we perturb/corrupt the features of all other input rows.\nThe results in Table 2 show that for some datasets NPT relies on these other rows, and for other datasets it does not.\nIn the latter case, the predictions of NPT depend only on the input row of interest, hence NPT (as a function of its input test point and the train set) \u2018collapses\u2019 to parametric prediction which depends only on the input test point.\nWe would be interested in discussing additional ways in which we could investigate this, but note that, as far as we know, NeurIPS guidelines discourage the upload of any novel figures during the discussion period.\n\nWe hope that our response and the new ablations have adequately addressed your concerns.\nWe would greatly appreciate it if you could engage with us during the discussion period on any remaining barriers to raising your score.\n\nThank you,\n\nThe Authors",

    "review": "The intersection of non-parametric models and deep parametric models is an area that has garnered much attention (and rightfully so, in my opinion). Works such as Neural Processes, Deep Gaussian Processes, and Deep Kernel Learning have had significant impact. The proposed NTP model advances these previous works in significant, not incremental, ways. It provides a novel architecture, which has capabilities not achieved by previous works. In particular, I believe the paper offers the following merits:\n\n* **Innovative Architecture** - The NPT architecture is novel and interesting and offers new perspectives on the ways to design and parameterize deep transformer-like architectures.\n* **Inspiration for Future Work** - The paper has the potential to lead to future work both in advancing NPT-like methodologies as well as applications of NPT to a wide array of other tasks. \n* **Empirical Analysis** - The authors carefully design experiments to test the performance of the model in different characteristics of the model. These provide insights into how the model behaves in particular circumstances. \n* **Well written** - The manuscript is very clearly written and is a pleasure to read. The figures and illustrations are clear and informative. The experimental hypotheses are clearly defined and experiments are illustrative of the merits of the approach. The description of the model is also clear and well motivated.  \n\nOverall, I think that this is a very strong paper. Here are some ways in which I think it could be improved: \n\n* **Retrieve and Edit** - There are seemingly some similarities between approaches such as retrieve-and-edit models that retrieve relevant instances and transform them to make a prediction for a target instance, e.g. (Hashimoto et al, 2018), inter-alia. It would be interesting to explore the relationship between such approaches and NPT. \n* **Transductive, Case-based, Label Propagation** - Classic approaches such as transductive learning or case-based reasoning I believe are also quite relevant to NPT. Both of these paradigms have also seen a recent revival combining deep learning models and transductive / case-based approaches. It would also be interesting to understand relationships between label propagation models (say on fully connected graphs) and the NPT model. \n* **Structured Prediction** - Many structured prediction tasks can naturally extended their associated models / objectives / energy functions to the dataset level, it might be interest to understand relationships between NPT and structured prediction models. \n* **Differences from Interpolation** - I am a bit unsure that I follow the argument in lines 170-172: \"For example, NPTs could learn to assign test datapoints to clusters of training datapoints, and predict on those points using interpolation of the training targets in their respective cluster. We explore the ability of NPTs to solve such complex reasoning tasks in \u00a74.2.\" . In 4.2, what I am having trouble with is why this is a reasoning task rather than an interpolation task. Isn't an interpolative to put all interpolation weight on the unmasked 'copy' of the masked instance?\n* **Theoretical results** - I don't think this is a requirement of the paper. I think that the empirical analysis is illustrative of the method. The impact of the paper could perhaps be improved with a theoretical analysis of the method.\n\n**Update after author response** Thanks very much to the authors for their response. I believe this is a interesting paper with many notable merits. \n",
    "comment": "Dear reviewer iTJu,\n\nWe sincerely thank you for your hard work and helpful feedback.\nWe ask that you read our comment above, addressed to all reviewers, first.\nBelow we address your specific comments as best as we can, and we hope you will engage with us actively during the discussion period to clarify any remaining points.\n\n## Suggested Related Work\n\nThank you for suggesting the additional references.\nWe will significantly extend our discussion of related work (S. 3, Appendix D), including comparisons to retrieve-and-edit models, transductive and case-based models, label propagation, and structured prediction. We also believe these connections are highly interesting and worth exploring.\nIf there are specific references you would like us to mention (in addition to Hashimoto et al., 2018), please list them during the discussion period.\n\n## Differences to Interpolation\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention.\nTo make sure we understood your question correctly, could you please clarify if by \u2018interpolative\u2019 you are referring to simple non-parametric models, like k-NN and Gaussian processes, that predict by simply \u2018interpolating\u2019 from the training data; whereas a reasoning task should require a more complex sequence of operations?\nWe feel that the semi-synthetic tasks in S. 4.2 can be called \u2018reasoning\u2019 tasks as there exists a distinct sequence of logical/computational \u2018reasoning\u2019 operations (compare features, copy and paste target) that leads to a perfect solution that is, in this case, even independent of the input data distribution.\nFurther, the extensions to S. 4.2 we present in Appendix B.1.2, where, e.g, a \u201c+1\u201d must be subtracted from the lookup target row, can no longer be solved with a simple \u2018interpolative\u2019 model like k-NN/GPs.\nWe will clarify our phrasing in ls. 170-172 as well as in S. 4.2 to make this more clear to future readers!\n\n## Theoretical Results\n\nThank you for the suggestion of studying the theoretical properties of NPTs further.\nIn Appendix A, we study the equivariance properties of NPTs, which we believe to be crucial to their empirical success, and provide a theoretical analysis of the model.\nWe would be happy to extend our theoretical analysis further, and would gladly try to incorporate any concrete ideas you might have in mind.\nThese would be a good topic to discuss during the discussion period!\n\n## Biases Manifest Differently in NPT\n\nThis is a really interesting point, thanks for bringing it up.\nIn our opinion, the fact that the training data is explicitly part of the NPT model (at test time) leads to interesting questions when considering bias. \nIn Appendix F, we speculate that NPT might allow for new ways of adjusting for biased/unfair predictions: \u201cInstead of retraining the model to elicit changes in prediction [...] NPT could be \u2018prompted\u2019 with a different set of context datapoints to modify its predictive behaviour.\u201d\nIs this similar to what you had in mind?\n\nThank you,\n\nThe Authors",

My only reservations are related to the significance of the results, particularly for the machine learning community. As the authors mention, there are plenty of ways of getting around the aforementioned under-estimation bias, and in the context of \"uncertainty estimation,\" it is arguably more common to use quantile regression as a sub-routine in a larger conformal prediction type of procedure,  rather than to pay particular attention to the coverage of the quantile regressor itself. The results here are of a fundamentally statistical nature, which I still think is fine for NeurIPS, but considering that quantile regression is a now-classical and well-studied topic, I would be surprised if similar insights did not already exist in the statistics literature, but I am not sufficiently familiar with that literature.

    "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful reviews!\n\n**\u201c... significance of the results, particularly for the machine learning community\u2026 arguably more common to use quantile regression as a sub-routine in a larger conformal prediction type of procedure, rather than to pay particular attention to the coverage of the quantile regressor itself\u201d**\n\nWe agree that there are more advanced algorithms that build on quantile regression as a subroutine (e.g. the conformal quantile regression of Romano et al. 2019). However, we believe understanding the behavior of the quantile regressor itself is also worthy, as it is a classical and arguably quite simple algorithm, achieves consistency with infinite samples, but is observed to often under-cover in reality when used alone. As quantile regression is still used a lot, our theoretical results could offer helpful insights to when / how much it tends to under-cover, even when it is used as a subroutine of a larger procedure.\n\n**\u201c... considering that quantile regression is a now-classical and well-studied topic\u2026 would be surprised if similar insights did not already exist in the statistics literature\u201d**\n\nWe believe the main reason why such results did not exist in the literature is because this under-coverage bias shows up when $d,n$ are large and on the same scale, and in theory this can only be captured by the proportional limit regime where $n,d\\to\\infty$ and $d/n=O(1)$. Existing theories either consider the asymptotic case ($d$ fixed, $n\\to\\infty$), in which case the coverage converges correctly to $\\alpha$, or provide finite-sample error bounds in finite $n,d$ case but do not tell the sign of the coverage error (cf. Line 181 - 190 in the paper for more discussions). Technical tools for analyzing ERM problems in the proportional limit regime only appeared in the past few years (e.g. Donoho and Montanari 2016; Thrampoulidis et al. 2018), which may explain why previous work on quantile regression has not considered this regime and reached similar conclusions.\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful comments on our paper!\n\n**\u201conly the classical linear quantile regression algorithm with pinball loss is analyzed... many advanced uncertainty quantification algorithms\u2026 paper would be much stronger if similar insights could be drawn to these advanced approaches\u2026\u201d**\n\nWe first emphasize that the main focus of this paper is analyzing the exact coverage error including its sign and magnitude, and this was not understood even in the linear case (and cannot be deduced from existing theories on quantile regression). Therefore, we began with the linear model to have a precise understanding, which we found already requires new analyses. To complement this, in our experiments (Section 5.2) we test quantile regression with pinball loss + neural networks, and show that the under-coverage still happens (and is even more severe than the linear quantile functions). That said, we agree that theoretically analyzing more advanced algorithms such as quantile forests or conformal-based approaches would be an interesting direction for future work.\n\n**\u201cTheorem 1 requires both $n$ and $d$ go to infinity\u2026 don\u2019t know how easy / meaningful it is to \u2018model\u2019 an increasing data dimension beyond linear\u201d**\n\nBy increasing the dimension $d$, we meant for each $d$ we assume a different data distribution (in our case Gaussian linear model in $d$ dimensions), look at the behavior of the algorithm on this distribution, then let $d$ go to infinity together with the sample size $n$. Such limits can be properly defined for non-linear models too, although in prior work it is indeed the case that this limit is usually considered on linear models. We will clarify this in our revision.\n\nWe also remark that although taking the limit is required in theory, in simulations we observed that $d=100$, $n=200$ is already enough for the under-coverage bias to closely match our theoretical predictions at $d/n=\\kappa=0.5$ (Figure 1, Section 5.1). Therefore, from a more practical point of view, our conclusions hold at rather realistic values of $n,d$ and do not require them to be excessively large.\n\n**\u201cExcept for the sign of the coverage bias, finite-sample estimation error of linear quantile regression is well-studied, e.g. in Steinwart et al. 2011\u201d**\n\nAs we answered above, the sign of the coverage bias is indeed our motivating question, which we found was not well-studied in prior works (such as the finite-sample analysis of Steinwart et al. 2011). We also remark that our Theorem 1 not only tells the sign, but also shows the precise limiting value of the under-coverage bias in Gaussian linear models to be $C_{\\alpha, \\kappa}=\\alpha - (\\alpha-1/2)\\kappa + o(\\kappa)$ when $\\kappa=d/n$ is small. This magnitude is also not present in the finite-sample analysis of Steinwart et al. (2011) as it only gives an upper bound on the coverage error.\n\n**Line 192 \u201cover-coverage -> under-coverage\u201d**\n\nThanks for spotting this, it was our typo indeed. We will fix this in our revision.\n",

    "review": "Originality: Though some concepts like LDB and counterfactual have been used in other domains, to my knowledge, the framework proposed by this paper is original in the field of GNN explanation. However, the definition of counterfactual explanation seems broken. Please refer to the tech comments below.\n\nQuality: This paper is well-written and the authors make their idea and the workflow clear. However, the reviewer thinks more experiments are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the definition of noise in this paper is not very clear, without which robustness can\u2019t be clarified as well. Details will be described in following tech comments.\n\nClarity: the structure of this paper is well organized. It starts with the intuition and then get into the tech details. Each module(e.g. LDBs, counterfactual subgraph) is introduced following the pipeline of the proposed method, which makes the paper structure quite clear. \n\nSignificance: The experiments are conducted on three small datasets and consider several relevant baselines for GNN explanation. The results are significantly better than the baseline approaches on criteria fidelity and AUC save for the AUC performance on Mutagenicity. \n\nTech Comments: \n\n1. Definition of counterfactual explanation: According to the previous, the definition of counterfactual explanation is \u201cif X had been different, Y would not have occurred\u201d, rather than \u201cif X had not occurred, Y would not have occurred\u201d as claimed by the authors. That means, the authors only replace the subgraph (X) with the empty set, rather than the reference subgraph (that could be the empty or other subgraphs). Moreover, recent studies find that simply replacing the features of interest (X) with the empty could cause the distribution shift from the complete graphs. Please explain or clarify these points.\n    - Explaining image classi\ufb01ers by counterfactual generation. In ICLR, 2019.\n\n2. Definition of noise: I cannot find a clear definition of noise in this paper. I think it\u2019s necessary to clarify it when you are discussing robustness. For example, what does 30% noise mean? Adding random noise whose magnitude is 30% of the original node feature or randomly adding or deleting 30% edges or do them both?\n\n3. Robustness in GNN explanation field: It will be much better if the authors can explain more why the robustness defined in this paper is important. In CV domain, after adding noise to the panda picture, the NN cannot classify it correctly anymore while human being can\u2019t see any difference between the original pic and the noisy one. However, taking mutagenicity for example, adding or deleting 30% of edges will make the original molecule a totally different one even though the GNN doesn\u2019t change the prediction(noxious or not). In these case, it\u2019s reasonable for an explainer to identify a different subgraph. So, I don\u2019t think evaluating the robustness based on the similarity between S\u2019 and S makes perfect sense to me.\n\n4. The ablation study of the counterfactual term.

Please explain or clarify these points.\nExplaining image classi\ufb01ers by counterfactual generation. In ICLR, 2019.**\n\n**A1**: There are several versions of counter-factual explanations in literature. We are using the definition of counter-facutal explanation given in the 4th paragraph of Section 6.1 of the book \"Interpretable Machine Learning: A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable\" written by Christoph Molnar (https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/). In this book, a counterfactual explanation is defined as: \"A counterfactual explanation of a prediction describes the smallest change to the feature values that changes the prediction to a predefined output.\" As introduced in Lines 309-311, the proposed RCExplainer uses a set of edges of the input graph as explanations. Since an edge of the input graph only have two status: exist and not-exist, changing the status of an existing edge is equivalent to removing it. Therefore, if we treat X as a set of edges that explains the prediction of a GNN, then following the definition proposed by Christoph Molnar, changing the status of X means removing the edges contained in X from the input graph. \n\nWhen generating X, we strictly follow the definition proposed by Christoph Molnar to require the set of edges to be the minimum. This is achieved by applying the sparsity constraints illustrated in Lines 288-292. We will clarify this more clearly in the revised paper.\n\nThe studies in the ICLR 2019 paper is very interesting. The authors agree that masking interpreted image area by black/empty pixels may cause distribution shift of images. However, there has been no similar study on graphs yet. The latest counterfactual explanation method on graph neural networks proposed in [20] generate explanations by removing edges of input graphs. Therefore, the proposed RCExplainer follows this routine to generate explanations as a set of edges of the input graph. Recall that RCExplainer applies a sparsity constraint in lines 288-292 to reduce the number of edges forming an explanation, and removing a small number of edges from an input graph is less likely to cause a large distribution drift.\n\n\n\n**Q2: Definition of noise: I cannot find a clear definition of noise in this paper. I think it\u2019s necessary to clarify it when you are discussing robustness. For example, what does 30% noise mean? Adding random noise whose magnitude is 30% of the original node feature or randomly adding or deleting 30% edges or do them both?**\n\n**A2**: We define x% of noise as follows:\nWe randomly perturb features of x% nodes to flip their labels, and also simultaneously replace x% of edges randomly in the graph. This replacement of edges is done by randomly removing x% of the existing edges and adding same number of new edges randomly in the graph.  This is briefly mentioned in lines 359-360.\n\nPlease note that adding noise to the input graph can change the GNN\u2019s prediction. If the prediction changes, the explanation cannot be expected to remain consistent for the perturbed input graph. Therefore while computing robustness, only those perturbations are considered valid that do not change the GNN\u2019s original prediction. The perturbations that flip the GNN\u2019s prediction are ignored and not considered for the evaluation. \n\nWe will explain this more clearly in our revised paper.\n\n\n\n**Q3: Robustness in GNN explanation field: It will be much better if the authors can explain more why the robustness defined in this paper is important. In CV domain, after adding noise to the panda picture, the NN cannot classify it correctly anymore while human being can\u2019t see any difference between the original pic and the noisy one. However, taking mutagenicity for example, adding or deleting 30% of edges will make the original molecule a totally different one even though the GNN doesn\u2019t change the prediction (noxious or not). In this case, it\u2019s reasonable for an explainer to identify a different subgraph. So, I don\u2019t think evaluating the robustness based on the similarity between S\u2019 and S makes perfect sense to me.**\n\n**A3**: The robustness of DNN explanations in CV domain has a similar meaning as the robustness of explanations in graph domain. According to Ghorbani et al. (Interpretation of Neural Networks is Fragile, AAAI2019, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10547.pdf), Ghorhani et al. claimed that many interpretations on neural networks are fragile because they can \u201cgenerate adversarial perturbations that produce perceptively indistinguishable inputs that are assigned the same predicted label, yet have very different interpretations.\u201d Here, the concept of \u201cfragile\u201d is the opposite of \u201crobustness\u201d. An interpretation is said to be fragile if \u201csystematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations without changing the label\u201d. Otherwise, the interpretation is said to be robust. It is worth mentioning that Ghorbani et al. are using the intersections and rank order correlation between interpretations on images to evaluate the fragile level of interpretations (in Figure 3 of the paper). This aligns quite well with evaluating the robustness of explanations by the similarity of explanations S and S\u2019.\n\nTo show that our robustness definition in the graph domain aligns well with the robustness concept proposed by Ghorhani et al. AAAI 2019, we elaborate the key idea of robust explanations in graph domain as follows. Given an input graph that is perturbed/modified by random noise, if the GNN's prediction on the perturbed input graph does not change, then the corresponding explanation should not change dramatically. Following this intuition, an explanation is said to be \"robust\", if it stays stable when an input graph is perturbed by random noise, but the prediction made by the GNN on the perturbed input graph stays unchanged. Otherwise, the explanation is not robust, which corresponds well with the concept of \u201cfragile\u201d proposed by Ghorbani et al. Robust explanations are not sensitive to the artifacts of the input data which makes them more trustworthy than not-robust explanations. \n\n\nNow we discuss the example of mutagenicity raised by the reviewer. If deleting 30% of edges of an original molecule but the GNN still predicts the same label, then it is highly possible that that graph structure that dominates the GNN\u2019s prediction is still dominating the prediction. Since an explanation should focus on the dominating graph structures, it should not change dramatically. \n\nIn conclusion, it is meaningful to evaluate the robustness of explanations by the similarity between S\u2019 and S.\n\n\n**Q4: The ablation study of the counterfactual term. The effectiveness of the counterfactual part needs to be demonstrated by setting \u03bb=1or deleting the counterfactual term L_opp in eq(8).**\n\n**A4**: We present such an ablation study on BA-2Motifs in lines 778-783 of Appendix G. As shown in Figure 8, weighing the counterfactual term $\\mathcal{L}\\_{opp}$ less in the net loss by setting $\\lambda$ close to 1 causes the fidelity to drop significantly across all levels of sparsity.  \nWe see similar trend for the other datasets and the results can be seen at the below link where we show the results of ablation study for $\\lambda$ on multiple datasets .\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1iQ_OYK6FHZ7tBYlC39_3-nIT_Ud47U_s/view?usp=sharing\n\nWe also see that when $\\lambda=0.2$ and both of the loss terms: $\\mathcal{L}\\_{same}$ and $\\mathcal{L}\\_{opp}$  are active,  the common decision logic of GNN is effectively leveraged by RCExplainer to produce superior robustness performance.\n\nWe will include these results in the revised paper.\n",

The authors even say that r(P,c) induced by LDBs in the \\tilde{H} might have instances that aren\u2019t predicted as the correct class. Do the explanations change depending on the sampling of H? If so, this is not robust at all.\n* Comparison to existing methods is weak:\n   * They say existing methods are not robust to noise bc they optimize for individual inputs. They cite PGExplainer here as one of the methods. Still, unless I did not understand correctly, it does not optimize for individual inputs and instead learns a general explanation model applied to individual inputs.\n   * The comparison to CF-GNNExplainer is not fair, in my opinion. The method they propose is similar to CF-GNNExplainer in the way they build the CF explanation, but it has not been properly acknowledged in the paper. Even the loss functions are very similar, but this is not properly acknowledged, as well. Both methods learn a sparsifier that is then thresholded to find the edges to be removed.\n      * Also, I do not quite understand why authors refer to CF-GNNExplorer as an adversarial attack method. From my understanding of the paper, the main goal of CF-GNNExplainer is to build CF explanations and not adversarial samples.\n* The baselines mentioned in the experiments are not CF explanations at all. This makes the experiment not convincing at all. Also, the methods are for explaining node classifiers and not graph classification models.

Does it work as claimed in the paper?\n* The claim that the method is robust to noise is weakly supported by the experiments, in my opinion. For instance, in Mutagenicity, PGExplainer is close (although the error bars are separate) to the other two methods.\n   * Also, the robustness feature is poorly motivated in the paper. Why is it essential to be robust? If you don\u2019t mention proper motivations, the problem definition feels rather artificial.\n\nMinor remarks:\n* Requirements require \u2192 Can you change this?

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for valuable comments. Below is our response.\n\n**Q1: First and foremost, in all of the counterfactual explanation techniques, there is usually a component of \u201cminimality\u201d that is missing from this work. In general, one seeks to make a few modifications as possible to the input sample. This aspect is totally absent in this research and, in my opinion, is of fundamental importance in this area. In fact, even in the experimental section, one can see that authors always measure fidelity as a function of sparsity but, typically, one should seek the smallest modification possible and then measure fidelity, sparsity, and size of the recommendation.**\n\n**A1**: As illustrated in Lines 288-292, we applied sparsity constraints in a similar way as [41] to select only a small number of edges in the input graph G as part of our explanation. So, yes, we do have the component of \u201cminimality\u201d in our formulation.\n\nIt is true that we measure fidelity at different levels of sparsity in our experiments. This is necessary due to the following reasons. \n\nFirst, we need to comprehensively compare the explanation quality of all baseline methods at different levels of sparsity. As shown in Figure 1, the sparsity of explanations largely affects the fidelity performance. Thus, one cannot tell the clear advantage of one method A over another method B, if A outperforms B at one sparsity level, but performs worse than B at another sparsity level. Our evaluation method is also consistent with the evaluation used by [43] where fidelity vs sparsity plots are used for comparison of SubgraphX with the other baselines. As shown in Figure 1, the proposed RCExplainer consistently outperforms the other baseline methods at every level of sparsity. Thus, we can comprehensively observe the advantage of RCExplainer over the baseline methods.\n\nSecond, we need to fairly compare with some baseline methods that do not precisely control the sparsity of explanations. Since sparsity largely affects fidelity, it is unfair to compare the fidelity of two explanations A and B with different levels of sparsity. As discussed in lines 698-703 of the paper and mentioned in [43], the baseline methods SubgraphX [43] and PGM-Explainer [34] cannot precisely control the sparsity of explanations. To fairly compare with these methods, we have to compare the fidelity performance of explanations on similar levels of sparsity, which requires to compare the fidelity performance at different sparsity levels. Furthermore, for methods that could control the sparsity of explanations, the sparsity could be optimized to the extreme (e.g., selecting only one edge as explanation). However, for methods that could not control the sparsity of explanations, the sparsity of explanation is determined by data. These methods usually select more than one edge as explanation. If we ask all methods to seek the smallest modification possible (i.e., the largest sparsity), then we are going to compare the fidelity of explanations at different sparsity levels, for example, a method A may only select 1 edge as the explanation, but another method B may select 10 edges as the explanation. A comparison like this is unfair to explanations with higher sparsity level. \n\n\n\n**Q2: The first half of the intuition in 4.1 makes sense, but this formulation also means that you have to use piecewise linear activation functions for this method to work. You want to extract a decision region with 2 properties:\nShould be induced by a subset of LDBs in H\nShould cover many instances in the training set, and all covered graphs should be predicted as the same classification**\n\n**A2**: It is true that the proposed RCExplainer has to work on GNNs with piecewise linear activation functions. Considering that a large proportion of existing GNN models are adopting piecewise linear activation functions such as ReLU, the proposed RCExplainer should be general enough to apply to a large family of GNNs.  How to model the decision regions of GNNs that do not use piecewise linear activation functions is a very interesting research topic, and we plan to investigate this direction in the near future. There are some studies [1] that use piecewise linear activations to approximate other activations. Therefore, our current work focused on piecewise linear activations may be used to extend to other activations in future.\n\n[1] Hu X, Liu W, Bian J, Pei J. Measuring model complexity of neural networks with curve activation functions. InProceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining 2020 Aug 23 (pp. 1521-1531). \n\n\n\n**Q3: Also, it is not really clear how LDBs are related to GNNs (not really considering that you base your formulation only on GCNs) as it could be used, in principle, in all deep learning mechanisms, right? In fact, I would like the authors to comment on how the method described in 4.2 is related to GNN.**\n\n**A3**: Yes, in principle, the concepts of LDB and decision region are applicable to general deep neural networks. Therefore, the decision region extraction method proposed in Section 4.2 potentially may be extended to other deep learning related tasks. \n\nExtracting decision region is an algorithmic component of the proposed RCExplainer. The extracted decision regions are intermediate results of RCExplainer, they cannot be directly used as explanations. To generate high-quality explanations on GNNs, we carefully design the explanation algorithm in Section 4.3. Both the decision region and the explanation algorithm are important for RCExplainer to work well on GNNs. \n\nWhile extracted decision regions may be a general vehicle to deliver explanations in other tasks, to make decision regions work in other tasks, careful task-related adaptation and extension need to be explored systematically, which are beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n\n\n**Q4: I find the end of 4.1 and 4.2 a bit hard to follow, but we see here that it involves sampling from H, which does not seem very robust because then the partitioning of O^d is dependent on which LDBs were sampled from H. The authors even say that r(P,c) induced by LDBs in the \\tilde{H} might have instances that aren\u2019t predicted as the correct class. Do the explanations change depending on the sampling of H? If so, this is not robust at all.**\n\n**A4**: Yes, the explanations may change depending on the samples of $\\mathcal{H}$. As shown in Figure 7 of the Appendix, the number of sampled LDBs affects the fidelity performance of RCExplainer at all levels of sparsity. However, this does not mean our explanations are not robust. As discussed in lines 771-777 and shown in Figure 7 in the Appendix, the Fidelity performance of RCExplainer converges fast and becomes stable at all levels of sparsity when the number of sampled LDBs increases from 50 to 70. This means that the explanations produced by RCExplainer are robust when enough LDBs are sampled. We have conducted more experiments to test a larger range of the number of sampled LDBs on the other data sets. The results consistently show the fast convergence of the fidelity performance when large enough number of LDBs are sampled. \n\nWe have also conducted qualitative studies to verify this robustness across multiple instances of RCExplainers trained with different sampled LDBs. We are also conducting the robustness experiment under this setting where we compare explanations of two different instances of RCExplainer on same input graphs. We use AUC for this comparison which is computed in similar fashion as described in lines 353-355. Our preliminary results on Mutagenicity and BA-2Motifs show that AUC score exceeds 0.95 on both of the datasets after both the models are trained for 200 epochs. As training progresses further, we see that AUC increases further and approaches 1. This is solid proof of our model's robustness. We will add these results to the paper once the experiments are complete on all of the datasets.\n\nIn lines 203-204, we mentioned that \u201cthe convex polytope $r(\\mathcal{P},c)$ induced by subset of boundaries in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}$ may contain instances that are not predicted as class $c$.\u201d. Here, an instance not predicted by the GNN as class $c$ does not mean the instance is not predicted as the correct class. It only means the instance is predicted by GNN to be a different class from class $c$. \n\nAccording to [4] and illustrated in lines 149-158, every convex polytope $r(\\mathcal{P},c)$ induced by the full set of LDBs $\\mathcal{H}$ is guaranteed to contain input graphs that are predicted by the GNN as class $c$. However, since $\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{H}$, we may miss some LDBs in $\\mathcal{H}$. Therefore, the $r(\\mathcal{P},c)$ induced by $\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}$ may miss some LDBs. Thus, the $r(\\mathcal{P},c)$ induced by $\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}$  may cover a larger area in the feature space $\\mathcal{O}^d$, which means it may include some input graphs that are not predicted by the GNN as class $c$. However, this does not affect the robustness of RCExplainer, because most of the input graphs contained in $r(\\mathcal{P},c)$ will still be predicted by GNN as class $c$. Thus, $r(\\mathcal{P},c)$ is still carrying the GNN\u2019s common decision logic, which is the key to robust explanation.  This is supported by the results in Figure 7 of Appendix, where we show after sampling large enough number of decision boundaries, the performance of model maximizes and saturates. This clearly indicates that such instances even if they might exist do not affect the performance of the model.\n\n**We answer the remaining questions in next comments.**",

It is less convincing to claim the human intuition here without user studies.**\n\n**A1**: \"aligning well with human intuition\" means a counterfactual explanation is easy to be comprehended by a human. It has been demonstrated by psychologists that counterfactuals elicit causal reasoning in humans [1, 2, 3] and are thus intuitive. There have also been user studies to confirm that users prefer counterfactual explanations over case-based reasoning [4, 5]. \n\nOur method is designed to produce counterfactual explanations; thus the produced explanations are expected to be easy to comprehend. We also showed some qualitative results in Table 4 of Appendix: the proposed RCExplainer can accurately identify the target motifs that align well with human understanding. We will describe this more precisely and add more qualitative results to the revised paper.\n \n\n\n[1] Ruth Byrne. 2008. The Rational Imagination: How People Create Alternatives to Reality.

I'm curious how to make the overall efficiency much better? More complexity analysis would be more trustworthy.**\n\n**A2**: One technical contribution we made in this paper is to prove that the optimization problem in Equation (4) is a SCSC problem, which is NP-hard according to [5]. The SCSC problem has been well investigated in literature. Since solving the SCSC problem is not the major focus of this paper, we adopt a classical greedy solution proposed by [36]. [36] also establishes in-depth theoretical analysis on the complexity as well as the solution quality of the greedy algorithm. We will clarify this in the revised paper.\n\nWe would also like to highlight that LDB extraction is part of training and does not affect inference time of our explanation model.  Moreover, we find empirically that LDB extraction phase takes no more than 2 minutes for each of the three datasets that we use in the experiments. Our training time on each dataset is at par with the training time of PGExplainer. Here is the training time comparison:\n\n||Mutagenicity|BA_2Motifs|NCI1|\n|--|----------|----------|----|\n|PGExplainer| 30.0s \u00b1 3.5|5.5s \u00b1 1.3|30.7s \u00b1 4.5|\n|RCExplainer (Ours)|33.2s \u00b1 2.4|5.8s \u00b1 1.4|29.2s \u00b1 3.6|\n\nThe mentioned training time (in seconds) is per epoch and we use 500 epochs in training of both the methods. We will add the training times to the paper. More training details are mentioned in lines 676-688 of Appendix E.\n\n\n**Q3: In order to better evaluation the explainability, how to quantify the significance of G_{E/S} changes? In [1], it use 'faithfulness' to justify the explainability. I hope similar notion could be adopted as explainability evaluation.**\n\n**A3**: The \u2018fidelity\u2019 [28,43] metric used in our paper is a standard evaluation metric to measure the faithfulness of the explanations on graph predictions. Fidelity is defined as the drop in the confidence of a model\u2019s original predictions after masking the explanation in the input graph. This can be written as $\\phi(G\\_{E}) \u2013 \\phi(G\\_{E/S})$. As we can see that this metric clearly emphasizes the significance of generated explanation in the original prediction. Smaller the value of prediction confidence $\\phi(G\\_{E/S})$  on subgraph $G\\_{E/S}$, larger is the fidelity, which further indicates higher faithfulness. \n\nThe definition of fidelity also aligns well with the definition of \u201ccomprehensiveness\u201d which is a faithfulness metric defined in [1]. The comprehensiveness is defined as change in the prediction score after removing the rational from the input. Therefore, comprehensiveness emphasizes the role of identified rational in the prediction and ensures all the input features important for the prediction are selected as part of the rational. In other words, the rational is comprehensive.\n\n[1] ERASER : A Benchmark to Evaluate Rationalized NLP Models\n ",

    "submission_title": "The Sensory Neuron as a Transformer: Permutation-Invariant Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning",
    "review": "This work provides an interesting and highly valuable method for building RL models robust to various types of noise and capable of out-of-distribution generalization, which is a highly important and widely pursued goal in RL. To attain this goal, the authors propose a novel framework based on Set Transformers (a Transformer-based method for permutation-invariant neural-network analysis of datasets) and also based on concepts of cellular automata. The authors rigorously examine the properties of their new framework using a diverse set of standard RL tasks. As a result, the authors show impressive capabilities of their model to perform robustly in the presence of large-scale occlusions, noise, and out-of-distribution versions of the tasks. With that said, the text could use numerous clarifications and a comprehensive methods section, which would make the paper accessible for the broader NeurIPS community. Overall, the novel model, sound methodology, thorough testing, and highly significant results presented in this paper make it a valuable contribution for NeurIPS.\n\nSpecific comments:\n\nAlthough the paper seems to have all necessary details to be understood, these details appear to be scattered throughout the text (and throughout the referenced literature) which may require reading the paper 2-3 times to cover all the important details. To this end, I suggest making use of unlimited supplementary space to write comprehensive methods, which \u2013 alone \u2013 would be sufficient to reproduce the model and the experiments.\n\nThe paper may also benefit from adding the details of the framework to the main text. Notably, the Set Transformers used here are much less known than the original Transformer framework, so it may be unfair to expect the reader to know its details or to be motivated to read a separate paper on it. As a good example, the Set Transformers paper itself starts with a brief yet sufficient introduction of the Transformer framework and explains the design choices for the Set Transformer framework immediately upon their appearance. One of such design choices \u2013 not explained in the current paper \u2013 is that SensoryNeuron, just like Set Transformers, attends the input data (Keys, Values) to a (smaller) set of separately learned/handcrafted Query embeddings \u2013 unlike the usual Transformers attending the elements of input data to each other. It is important to explain that learnable/predefined Query embeddings do not depend on the input and decrease the algorithm\u2019s complexity from quadratic to linear.\n\nThe mathematical notation here can also be simplified, as it appears to have multiple variables which are not used. For example, the matrices Wq, Wk, and Wv were originally introduced in Transformer to be used in multi-head attention, where the different versions of these matrices were applied to the same Queries, Keys, and Values. It appears that the framework presented in this submission does not use multi-head attention, so these matrices can be sacrificed for the clarity of how the main model is explained. The matrix Wk, in particular, can be described together with the function Fk as both of them are implemented using neural networks \u2013 stacked with each other and thus forming a single neural network. The same goes for Fv and Wv \u2013 both being implemented as the identity matrices and thus unnecessary. Decomposition of Q and Wq is justified as it decreases the overall number of parameters and because Q is not learnable \u2013 but this distinction does not need to be immediately introduced. Focusing rather on the roles of Q, K, and V would make the paper more accessible for the broad audience.\n\nFinally, I found the neuroscience-oriented introduction to this paper questionable. While the paper presents interesting, significant, and valuable results regarding the robustness of the algorithm to various types of noise, taking advantage of additional data, and out-of-distribution generalization \u2013 these results are summarized only at the end of the paper. At the same time, a reader who starts reading the text from the beginning may falsely think that the purpose of the paper is to learn from/replicate a biological phenomenon. Moreover, the introduction \u2013 in light of the details of the proposed model \u2013 may leave a reader with the impression that the brain information processing is permutation invariant, like in zero-shot learning, whereas it\u2019s not. The neuroscience papers cited in the introduction, such as reverse biking or learning to \u201csee\u201d using an electrode matrix, clearly mention the significant time tolls of acquiring such skills. Although the presented work may have future neuroscience implications, the line of the argument currently presented here does not make a solid connection to neuroscience and, as such, needs to be revised/shrunk. Instead, the paper can start from the useful properties of the model, as outlined in the conclusions. The same goes for the abstract. The reclaimed space can be used for a detailed description of the SensoryNeuron, which is a central part of this work.\n\nI would like to highlight here that all my suggestions above do not devalue the significance and the validity of the results. They are intended to highlight that a thorough explanation of the design choices, a broader overview of the Transformer, and starting from the robustness/generalization properties will make the paper a more accessible read for the broad NeurIPS audience. Even in the current format, this work is publishable in NeurIPS.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n-Why is the pass-through function Fv needed at all? Could you please briefly comment on the intuition why Fv, normally being a learnable parameter in Transformers, does not require learning here?\n\n-Could you please also compute the statistical significance for the RL results? Given the huge standard deviation in the CartPole task, the SensoryNeuron\u2019s apparent slight deficiency may not be statistically significant, which will strengthen your claim.\n\n-Can you please explain why you spatially arrange the messages Mt in the AtariPong task? Naively, it would seem that, as you permute your sensory neurons, the 2D arrangement of their messages will be also random and the convolution on top of these messages will learn the same as the feedforward connectivity?",

As R4 pointed out, our approach is not biologically inspired, but rather, our aim is to directly perform shuffled sensory tasks in a zero-shot setting, something that us mere humans cannot do without devoting a significant amount of time to re-adjust. For the upside-down glass, left-right bicycle experiments, blind sensory substitution experiments mentioned, it is the fact that we *are* able to eventually perform them, that had inspired us to see if we can also get RL agents to explicitly work on shuffled tasks really well, but not in the same way that we ourselves perform them. To avoid giving the wrong impression, we will shrink / reward the abstract and intro, as R4 suggested.\n\n2. **Improving Methods section and adding background material**\n\nThe clarity of the methods section (with regards to both the writing and notation) will be improved (R3 had similar concerns). We would also like to add a background section on attention, permutation invariance, set transformer, prior to the methods section, as R4 suggested, so that we do not need to assume that the reader is already familiar with those concepts, thereby being able to engage a broader audience.. But rather than putting the background material in the Appendix as R4 suggested, we think it may be a good idea to incorporate it in the main text, which we believe to be manageable if we utilize the extra allotted page upon publication. If there isn\u2019t enough space, we will put the background material in the Appendix as R4 suggested, and refer to it in the main text.\n\nWe are encouraged by R4\u2019s words that our results for PI RL agents and investigations on practical benefits of PI in RL are highly significant and valuable contributions to the NeurIPS community, and we would like to also improve the format to make it more broadly accessible for the entire NeurIPS audience, and not just to be read by the sub-community of members involved in attention and RL, so hopefully more people in the community can also explore this interesting area.\n\n__Our answers to specific questions asked by R4:__\n\n*> Why is the pass-through function Fv needed at all? Could you please briefly comment on the intuition why Fv, normally being a learnable parameter in Transformers, does not require learning here?*\n\nWe use Fv as a convenient place to group data preprocessing operations. In vision tasks, Fv flattens the patch data for matrix multiplication with Wv. In non-vision tasks, the raw observations are in a good shape, hence Fv is a pass-through function. We isolate learnable parameters from Fv and put them in Wv (this is to show the formation of attention explicitly as we mentioned in Sec. 3). Wv also helps reshape the output data for the downstream network. AttentionNeuron\u2019s output is Mt = \\sigma( QWq x transpose(KWk) ) x (VWv), which is a MxN tensor where M is the number of rows in Q and N is the number of columns in Wv. For non-vision tasks, we use MLP policy and N=1 suffices, since V\u2019s shape is |o|x1 we hence set Wv to identity. For vision tasks, we treat Wv as a parameter matrix, and learn it during training.\n\n*> Could you please also compute the statistical significance for the RL results? Given the huge standard deviation in the CartPole task, the SensoryNeuron\u2019s apparent slight deficiency may not be statistically significant, which will strengthen your claim.*\n\nThe large variances come from the environment because the initial states were sampled from a wide range of possible settings, some of which can lead to instant failure. We tried to estimate more accurate mean scores by running for 1000 tests instead of 100 (hence the estimate of the mean is accurate to the order of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1000}}$ compared to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}$ for other experiments). To quantify this uncertainty, we also ran t-tests. The results give a p-value small enough (i.e. < 0.01) to suggest that the difference is significant. It is also expected that the baseline slightly outperforms our method, because AttentionNeuron needs to spend some time steps in each episode to identify the inputs, whereas the baseline does not.\n\n*> Can you please explain why you spatially arrange the messages Mt in the AtariPong task? Naively, it would seem that, as you permute your sensory neurons, the 2D arrangement of their messages will be also random and the convolution on top of these messages will learn the same as the feedforward connectivity?*\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that it is likely \u201cthe convolution on top of these messages will learn the same as the feedforward connectivity\u201d. We had such arrangements in the paper because we wanted to show that AttentionNeuron is a general layer and by only reshaping the output, it is compatible with many existing policy networks, e.g., MLP for the Cartpole and Ant, Convnet for Pong and AttentionAgent for CarRacing.\n",

    "review": "*Originality:* I think this paper\u2019s originality comes from the fact that it is a novel combination and then application of well-known techniques and concepts. The paper notes that Transformer\u2019s attention mechanism is known to be permutation invariant and applies it here to reinforcement learning, which is the primary novelty I see in this work. The paper suggests an angle of collective intelligence due to the AttentionNeuron architecture, where each of N sensory neurons sees one of each of N observation components. It seems that the transformation from input to sensory neuron layer is a generalized permutation matrix, and the paper\u2019s point is that this can be any generalized permutation matrix as long as the magnitude of each column remains the same (I think; I may not have all the details totally right). The connection to collective intelligence seems limited to a high-level abstraction, but I do think it\u2019s an elegant and unique approach to permutation invariance whether or not it would be considered collective. \n\n*Quality:* I think the methods and results of this paper are quite well-conceived and -executed. Though the method seems complex at first and to some degree needlessly complex, the discussion of design choices such as temporal memory and reduced network size is helpful. The solution is actually quite thoughtful, and the issues are more of presentation than content (discussed below). The experiments are impressive - the approach is used successfully in four different testbeds, some with multiple environments. Though there are some caveats with each one, particularly Atari Pong, the core message of permutation invariance seems to persist through the results. In my opinion, the paper is really strengthened by forgoing complicated cuts of data and various statistics to just show performance on a large range of testbeds. The only improvement may be ablations or analysis to rule out confounds.\n\n*Clarity:* This paper is somewhat difficult to comprehend. Section-specific critique: \n\nThe related work is quite ambitious. I think all but the attention section could be collapsed into a section about permutation invariance and *maybe* collective intelligence, though as I said in *Originality*, that connection seems vague. Many of these are only related loosely, and the authors say as much at the end of each paragraph. This paper presents an interesting layer architecture that achieves a clear and concrete goal, and related work about that goal and similar architectures is enough in my opinion. This related work section is confusing and to some degree feels overpromising despite a paper that doesn\u2019t need to overpromise. This makes the paper difficult to understand. \n\nIn the methods section, the notation is difficult to follow, partially because it is mostly in paragraph form. Figure 2 is quite helpful, though the 1:1 nature of the observation components to sensory neurons could be visually clearer, but the rest of the text on page 4 is dense with words and notation combined. What makes it more frustrating is that it is notation, not derivation or theory, so it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to follow; a diagram or creative visual aids for the central definitions might help. \n\nFinally, the results are very hefty. That\u2019s one of the biggest value-adds of this paper, but it\u2019s also overwhelming because it\u2019s presented as one long laundry list. I realize that each testbed is very different so it may be hard to have a claims-driven structure to this section, but it would be nice to see unifying stats or even unifying qualitative analysis earlier than Section 5. \n\n*Significance:* I think the ambitious and extensive related work section causes this paper to feel like it\u2019s overstating its significance; I don\u2019t think neuroscience is really a related field at all, nor am I convinced that this is an example of collective intelligence, nor do I know why it would make a difference. It\u2019s also hard to tell if permutation invariance itself is significant - I think the significance of the main contribution comes from the fact that it\u2019s 1) an elegant architectural approach (which builds on Transformer), unlike existing permutation-invariance works that require specific input formats and 2) application to reinforcement learning. If the language focused on what this paper is really doing, as opposed to big ideas that sound kind of like what it is doing, it would come across better. Nonetheless, I do think that this result is significant. The applications listed in section 5 are a good taste of what this method can do, and I suspect there are many more, and more immediate, applications that could be explored from this work.",

Specifically, we will incorporate some of R3\u2019s suggestions, and will make modifications to the writing:\n\n- Removal of the neuroscience subsection in the Related Works section, and briefly mention inspiration from neuroscience and psychology experiments in the intro. We agree with R3 that this will make the paper easier to understand, and also shorten it.\n\n- In the methods section, we will create a clear and simple table of notation (now that we have more space by shortening the related work section), to complement Figure 2 and the text. This could be similar to Supplementary Material\u2019s Table 1 (see pdf). We will also improve the dense text to make the methods section more clear and concise to read.\n\nIn addition to the writing, we have included results of additional model analysis and ablation studies into the text, which will specifically include:\n\n- A study of the attention patches for visual tasks. In CarRacing, we see that the patches with high attention scores tend to focus on the road edges and on the car in the original CarRacing task, but the degree in which the patches are still attending to the road for the zero-shot generalization tasks vary. This study could help one investigate the limitations of the generalization abilities of the model. (See response to R1 for more details)\n\n- A further T-SNE analysis on the permutation invariant (PI) representation vector m_t on the Shuffled Pong experiment demonstrates that the model has learned to cluster similar states that require similar actions in similar regions in the embedding space, suggesting that much of the \u2018heavy lifting\u2019 is done at the PI representation learning level, which can lead to limitations depending on the usefulness of the PI representation space learned.\n\n- Ablation experiments conducted to examine the importance of feeding in the previous action, and the importance of the sensory neuron unit vs the attention mechanism (See responses to R1 and R2), which ties in with R3\u2019s comment on the importance of PI vs collective intelligence (CI) concepts that are synthesized to produce this work.\n\nWe are really happy to see that R3 believes our work to be a novel combination of ideas from PI and CI applied to reinforcement learning, and that our results are significant, as the applications listed in Section 5 are a glimpse of what can be done with PI RL agents. We look forward to also seeing the NeurIPS community incorporate ideas from PI RL and also work on further investigating this fascinating area of RL in the future.\n",

    "review": "Pros\n1. Studies novel and biologically inspired permutation invariance question in the context of RL\n2. Experiments evaluate on several diverse environments (CartPole, Ant, Pong, CarRacing)\n3. Writing is generally clear\n\nCons\n1. It is not clear to me that permutation invariance is a practically significant or useful property\n2. Minimal ablations/comparisons to other methods in the experiments section\n\nAt a high level, I think this work is promising: it investigated a little-studied problem, permutation invariance to sensory observations in RL, motivated by observations in neuroscience regarding malleability in human brains. While it is not clear to me why this is a useful property from an engineering perpsective (i.e. as to why this can't be mostly tackled by the sensor interface), I think the direction studying biologically plausible RL/models is exciting. Furthermore, I think additional practical benefits gained as a result of permutation invariance (such as better generalization) are particularly exciting/important.\n\nMy main concerns are about the lack of comparisons/ablations to other methods, as the authors propose a method with several components but only compare to a feedforward network. I don't necessarily believe that my choices below would outperform the proposed method, but I think they would strengthen the paper and better contextualize the presented numbers. To propose a non-exhaustive but simple set of choices:\n1. Transformer/vision transformer: a transformer operating directly on the sensory inputs/image patches without positional embeddings is permutation invariant in the same sense as AttentionNeuron, but is a simpler approach (i.e. AttentionNeuron without the LSTM input cells). I think this ablation would make clear whether or not the recurrent layers are necessary, and if it is important that the bottom-level cells \"orient\" themselves,or if simply the upper-level attention layers are capable of making sense of the disordered information. I also think a comparison with positional embeddings would be useful, as vision transformers currently represent a state-of-the-art in image-based processing.\n2. LSTM after image processing: similarly to my above comment, this would clarify if this recurrent reorganization should be done at a low-level or a high-level. I think this is also biologically interesting, and practically it would be less computationally expensive since there wouldn't need to be an LSTM at every input location\n3. Other generalization methods: as I mentioned above, I think a particularly exciting experiment is Section 4.4/Table 4 because it promises that generalization could be improved via permutation invariance. However, the experiment only compares to a minimal baseline. I think comparing to other representation learning methods, such as bisimulation [1] or contrastive learning [2] (or others), would make this experiment more exciting.\n\nOverall, I think the direction toward permutation-invariant representations for sensory observations is underexplored and novel in the RL setting. Also, I think the authors investigate a few different interesting properties of the method, though I think the baselines are weak. As a result of the aforementioned weaknesses, I think this work currently does not meet the bar for publication. I am open to changing my score if the above issues are addressed, particularly if the comparisons to the transformer and high-level LSTM are included.\n\n=====\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Zhang, Amy et al 2020. \"Learning Invariant Representations for Reinforcement Learning without Reconstruction.\"\n\n[2] Srinivas, Aravind et al 2020. \"CURL: Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for Reinforcement Learning.\"\n\n=====\n\nUpdates\n\nI am satisfied with the authors' responses and additional baselines, therefore I am increasing my score from 4 to 6.",
    "comment": "*Note: we have referred to reviewer number rather than 4-letter code in our responses.*\n\n|  Reviewer  | Code   |\n|---|---|\n|  R1  |  dfwx  |\n|  R2  |  rWCR |\n|  R3  | Bz2K  |\n|  R4  | TUZP  |\n\n---\n\nThanks, R2, for your review and comments.\n\nWe are glad to hear that R2 believes that our work is interesting, and we also think that the direction towards permutation-invariant (PI) representations for sensory observations is an underexplored and novel area in RL setting. Along with R3 and R4, we\u2019re also excited about additional practical beneficial properties (such as robustness to noise / generalization / occlusion-resistant / variable number of sensors for an RL agent) as a result of PI.\n\nAs the main concern R2 has is the lack of comparisons / ablations in the work, we have looked at R2\u2019s suggestions and have run additional experiments to address these concerns. Below is a summary of what we have done:\n\n1. We have run an ablation where we feed the sensory inputs directly to the transformer (i.e. AttentionNeuron without the LSTM input cells), for the cart-pole swing-up task.\n\n2. Modifying (1), we replace the policy network (after the AttentionNeuron layer) from a feedforward network to a \u201chigh level\u201d LSTM network.\n\n3. We have performed experiments to compare the generalization results to the NetRand [lee2020] baseline, and spent some effort to improve the baseline method to make it perform as well as possible for our generalization task.\n\nFor (1) and (2), we performed the suggested ablations on the non-vision tasks (i.e. cart-pole swing-up for now, and can run on ant later on if requested), since they are the tasks that use LSTM sensory neuron networks. As discussed in the paper, the vision tasks do not use RNNs/LSTMs due to practical implementation and memory issues, and use FNNs.\n\n__The results of Ablations (1) and (2) are in the following table:__\n\n| Model in paper  |  (1)  No LSTM in AttentionNeuron | (2) High level LSTM  |\n|---|---|---|\n| 472 \u00b1 426  | 280 \u00b1 272  | 287 \u00b1 305  |\n\nWe present the results from ablation studies in the table, the significance of performance differences are evident from looking at the policies qualitatively, and verified by statistical tests. The first column shows the result from our proposed method (copied from Table 1 in the paper). In the second column, we replaced the LSTM(in=2, out=16) with Linear(in=2, out=16, activation=\u201dtanh\u201d) in the AttentionNeuron layer and left the other settings unchanged. Without temporal memory, AttentionNeuron is unable to infer the identity of the inputs and thus failed to keep its test performance. In the third column, we followed the reviewer\u2019s suggestion and moved the LSTM layer from AttentionNeuron to the policy network (i.e. low-level LSTM => high-level LSTM). Again, this model failed to match the proposed method, suggesting that temporal memory in the policy network cannot help AttentionNeuron identity inputs and generate a useful representation $m_t$ for the downstream controller, even if the controller has been upgraded to an LSTM from an FNN.\n\n__Discussion on the role of positional-embedding specifically in our method:__\n\nWe also wish to clarify the usage of positional embeddings in the paper. In particular, unlike traditional Transformer models, we do not use positional embeddings to explicitly label or identify the position of each patch, since that will break PI. In our scheme, each patch becomes one row in the Key and the Value matrices, and because we don\u2019t augment patches with positional embeddings, there is no specific id info the agent can rely on to infer the order if the rows in these matrices are permuted (hence PI property is preserved).\n\nThe part where we do use the pos-embeddings is in the Query matrix. Because the Query matrix is not affected by permuted inputs, the PI property is still preserved, so we can fill it with positional embeddings (i.e., positions=row indices). In Vision transformers, the Query matrix is created from patch data (not hard-coded) and is hence affected by permuted inputs. In principle the Query matrix can be learned but as discussed in the paper, we find using a pos-embedding scheme for hard-coding the Query matrix is efficient and is straightforward to implement.\n\n__Baseline comparison for generalization (3):__\n\nFor (3), we agree that our current work is lacking an adequate comparison with other generalization methods. This is something we also considered ourselves during the review period. Our understanding is that [zhang2020]\u2019s approach trains an agent on a set of numerous modified (or \u2018distracted\u2019) environments (rather than the original environment), to demonstrate generalization to another set of modified environments. The focus of [srinivas2020] is using contrastive learning to improve the sample efficiency of RL agents, rather than on achieving OOD generalization performance for RL tasks. In our task we simply want to train our agent on the single original environment only, and demonstrate generalization performance.\n\nWe decided to focus on a baseline method called NetRand [lee2020], a simple technique to improve the generalization ability of deep RL agents by using a randomized convnet that randomly perturbs input observations. In this method, the \u2018augmentations\u2019 are basically done internally in the randomized convnet, so in principle it can also be used to train an agent only on the original CarRacing environment to measure generalization performance.\n\nWe do wish to emphasize that in this work, we do not set out to propose a method explicitly to tackle (and claim SOTA performance on) OOD generalization for RL tasks; our goal is to train agents to tackle permutation-invariant RL environments, and we discover that generalization is one of the interesting and practical consequences of PI RL agents.\n\n*Table: CarRacing Generalization Baseline Comparison*\n\n| Method | Training Env | KOF | Mt. Fuji | Ukiyoe | DS | \n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| NetRand + CNN | 480 \u00b1 144 | 20 \u00b1 84 | 356 \u00b1 159 | 533 \u00b1 111 | -27 \u00b1 34 | \n| NetRand + AttentionAgent | 885 \u00b1 64 | -52 \u00b1 14 | 709 \u00b1 94 | 656 \u00b1 131 | 122 \u00b1 134 | \n| Ours | 801 \u00b1 147 | 646 \u00b1 189 | 503 \u00b1 152 | 661 \u00b1 140 | 171 \u00b1 146 | \n\nIn the first row of the table above, we trained the NetRand baseline method on the base CarRacing task. The CarRacing task proved a bit difficult for the baseline method, which achieved a mean score of ~ 480, but despite having a lower mean score, it demonstrably generalizes to a few of the modified environments to achieve scores in a similar ballpark.\n\nIn order to achieve a meaningful baseline comparison, we also spent some time improving the NetRand baseline method so that it can get close to SOTA (~ 900) on the base CarRacing task. To do that, we used NetRand as an input layer to the AttentionAgent (hard-attention) policy network, and trained the combination end-to-end using ES, which is consistent with our proposed method for this task. The NetRand+AttentionAgent combination achieved a respectable mean score of 885, and as we can see in the 2nd row of the above table, this approach also generalizes to a few of the unseen modifications of the CarRacing environment.\n\nCompared to our PI agent, our score on the base CarRacing task is lower, but this is expected since our agent would require some amount of time steps to identify each of the inputs (which could be shuffled), while the baseline does not (NetRand+AttentionAgent would simply fail on the shuffled versions of CarRacing). Despite this, our method still compares favourably on the generalization performance.\n\nWe do wish to reiterate that it is not our goal in this work to propose a state-of-the-art solution for RL generalization. While methods such as NetRand were explicitly designed to handle certain types of RL generalization tasks well (and we have confirmed here that its generalization properties do work as advertised, with a bit of work), our work\u2019s direction is on handling permutation invariant environments, and we simply want to show that the generalization property is an interesting consequence of PI RL agents. In principle, PI can even be combined with other methods focused on generalization to engineer stronger agents for this purpose.\n\nWe thank R2 again for the comments and suggestions. We have included the ablation studies and baseline comparison results in the paper. We gave it our best effort to address the 3 points, and also worked to provide a meaningful strong baseline comparison for the generalization task (which R2 thought to be particularly exciting/important), so we hope that R2 can consider improving the score to reflect the concerns addressed. If there are other issues, we are happy to discuss further.\n\n[lee2020] Lee et al., Network Randomization: A Simple Technique for Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning, ICLR 2020.\n",

    "comment": "*Note: we have referred to reviewer number rather than 4-letter code in our responses.*\n\n|  Reviewer  | Code   |\n|---|---|\n|  R1  |  dfwx  |\n|  R2  |  rWCR |\n|  R3  | Bz2K  |\n|  R4  | TUZP  |\n\n---\n\nThanks, R1, for your review. We address your comments below:\n\n*\u200b\u200b> Originality: The present result is an extension of the set transformer (ICML 2019). Although the title includes \"reinforcement learning\", actual learning takes evolutionary optimization and supervised learning (behavioral cloning).*\n\nOur work certainly builds on the permutation invariant (PI) property of self-attention. While Set Transformer (Lee et al. 2019) explored the PI property of Transformer for machine learning tasks, our work here specifically investigates PI policies in reinforcement learning environments. Along with R2, R3, and R4, we believe this is an underexplored and novel research direction.\n\nWe believe the paper is more than an extension of the Set Transformer paper. As R3 and R4 also pointed out, our work is a novel combination of concepts from Transformer\u2019s attention and self-organization / cellular automata, two fairly distinct subareas in the field. Set Transformer alone wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to address the tasks we have proposed in the work.\n\nRegarding whether this is considered *reinforcement learning*: The goal of the paper is also to train PI networks that can solve PI variations of reinforcement learning environments. Here, we consider ES to be a direct policy search method in RL. It has been demonstrated [1, 2] that CMA-ES is computing a natural policy gradient for updating the agent\u2019s policy, which we argue is compatible with the RL paradigm. The focus of our work is not on devising RL algorithms in the traditional sense, but rather on the design of agents that can solve PI RL environments.\n\nDue to the increased difficulty of training PI RL agents, we also discuss the use of behavioral cloning (BC) as a practical method for converting an existing, non-PI RL policy to one that is PI, since it is relatively straightforward for readers to be able to train existing well-known algorithms to obtain a non-PI policy. In the Ant experiment, we even discussed and compared both the RL (via ES policy search) approach with BC, allowing the reader to access the practicalities and tradeoffs for training PI policies on RL environments.\n\n*> Quality: I wish the role of the previous action input to the attention network is better discussed. My guess is that the network compares the changes in the observations and action taken to infers which channel carries the critical information for control. It would be interesting to analyze which channels actually gathered attention (e.g., the patches including the car and road boundary?) and how that is affected if the past action is not presented.*\n\nWe agree that the role of the previous action should be discussed in more detail, as it is one of the key components in our solution that enabled PI to work.\n\nThe combination of observations and previous actions helps each sensory neuron to infer the casual relationship between each input channel and the applied actions, which allows them to identify which input stream they are fed. This is important because the temporal stream of inputs alone may not be sufficient. For instance, in Cartpole two observations are sin($\\theta$) and cos($\\theta$) which only differ by a phase shift, making it difficult to for a sensory neuron to distinguish between one vs the other; In the Ant locomotion task, most observations are also joint angles and angular velocities of the legs which are numerically similarly bounded and change in similar patterns. \n\n__Ablation study of the effect of previous action:__\n\nBased on R1\u2019s suggestion, to verify the importance of the previous action, we conducted ablation studies in the Cart-pole Swing-up task when the past action is not added to AttentionNeuron (modified model). The mean score we have from the original model is 472, whereas the modified model gave a mean score of 372. Qualitatively, while the policy without the previous action can swing up the pole, and cannot reliably balance it for many time-steps.\n\n__Attention Patch Analysis for CarRacing:__\n\nBased on R1\u2019s suggestion, we have also analyzed the attention patches in the CarRacing task to confirm that, as R1 correctly pointed out, the patches are primarily scattered around the road and usually on the car (though not at all time steps). We have created an animation to visualize this, but we are not sure we can upload it to an anonymized link to share in the rebuttal (we checked with a PC and they mentioned that the NeurIPS policy is unclear and advised us against uploading anonymized links).\n\nThe following are more technical details as to how we visualized the attention, and how the patch analysis was conducted (Optional read):\n\nIn the trained CarRacing agent, the Query matrix has 1024 rows. Because we have 16x16=256 patches, the Key matrix has 256 rows, we therefore have an attention matrix of size 1024x256 (i.e. A=softmax{ Q x transpose(K) } ). To plot attended patches, we select from each row in the attention matrix the patch that has the largest value after softmax, this gives us a vector of length 1024. This vector represents the patches each of the 1024 output channels has considered to be the most important. 1024 is larger than the total patch count, however there are duplications (i.e. multiple output channels have mostly focused on the same patches). The unique number turns out to be 10-20 at each time step. We emphasize these patches on the observation images to create an animation.\n\n*> Significance: Although the architecture is reported to be inspired from sensory neurons, it has only remote link to neuroscience. Although not tested in this paper, permutation-invariant feature would be helpful in the context of multi-agent learning, where an agent need to work with a variable number of agents coming and going in random order.*\n\nWe agree that the link to neuroscience is only remote (mainly providing an inspirational role), so we have decided to shorten the related work section and cut down on the neuroscience discussion. We also agree that the PI property is indeed very useful to multi-agent RL (variable number of agents going in random order) and this has been explored in a few recent works (we cited a few of them, in particular, [Ref 50] in our paper). PI tasks for single-agent RL, however, haven't really been explored, which is why we decided to embark on this particular direction (rather than multi-agent direction) in this work.\n\nWe hope that our additional results of analyzing the attention patches in the PI agent, and also the discussion / additional ablation studies of removing the previous action address R1\u2019s concerns, and can encourage R1 to increase their score assessment of this work. We have included these additional ablation results (and attention patch analysis) in the paper.\n\n[1] Akimoto et al., Bidirectional Relation between CMA Evolution Strategies and Natural Evolution Strategies (2010)\n\n[2] Glasmachers et al., Exponential natural evolution strategies (2010)\n",

    "review": "### Strengths:\n\n* This paper is well written and answers many of the questions that arise while reading it immediately. \n* The analysis of certain issues in DBC is very nice to have. The theoretical section was (mostly) easy to follow and was informative. \n* The theory section has a clear added value in analysing the issues with DBC and proposing improvements. For example, compact spaces are assumed for continuous MDPs and this assumption is violated in DBC. This motivates the authors to propose normalizing the representations to a closed ball. Additionally, there is a degenerate solution when rewards are sparse, which motivates the authors to propose intrinsic rewards to prevent this from occurring. \n* An ablation study is included (though it is incomplete)\n* The paper does a good job of reviewing the related work, only missing a few related references (included below). \n\n### Weaknesses:\n* The choice of inverse dynamics as a regularizer is not well-motivated. This choice is not grounded in the same way that the rest of the paper is. For example, why choose an inverse dynamics model and not a different self-supervised loss? Why not a different combination of approaches? The motivation given for inverse dynamics could also be applied to reconstructions or contrastive coding. Additionally, there are no experimental results showing that an inverse dynamics model is best; as such this choice is the weakest part of the paper.\n* As there is no experimental comparison to other additions to DBC (e.g. different self-supervised learning approaches), it is unclear why  inverse dynamics is the preferred method to solving the issues with DBC.\n* The paper focuses heavily on one method; DBC, and as such is somewhat limited in scope.\n* The paper, while well-written, is not fully self-contained - certain terms are used without being defined. A few examples: \n  * What is a \u2018compact subset of $\\mathcal{S}$\u2019? \n  * What is a diameter of a state space? \n  * What is sup? The supremum? \n  * What is supp? Also the supremum? \n  * What is $\\mathcal{H}$ in line 259?\n  * What is a low dispersion reward?\n* According to the paper, DBC suffers from common metric learning problems, but there are no references included to other metric learning papers that exhibit similar issues.\n* If the intrinsic reward is based on the forward model error, it should not be useful under state collapse, as the error would be 0. \n* The non stationarity introduced by IR might be an issue in more complex environments.\n* Line 294: Claim: \u201cHence, we expect less disruption to the BSM encoding than other auxiliary tasks (e.g. reconstruction)\u201d. Reconstruction is not the only possible auxiliary task. What happens when using a better auxiliary loss, such as action-dependent contrastive coding?\n* Ablation study is incomplete -- DBC-ID and DBC-normed-ID are not included.\n* \u201c(Left) Our method significantly improves upon DBC [36] and is on par with SAC\u201d this looks like it isn\u2019t true, as SAC achieves a higher performance in the end.\n* The method isn\u2019t evaluated on the same benchmarks as DBC, with comparable levels of distraction (e.g. natural video). As a result, it is unclear what the performance improvement would be in those settings.\n\n\n### Questions:\n* \u201ctwo states that only differ in rewards far in the future should still not be bisimilar\u201d - Standard bisimilarity is defined over immediate, not future rewards. Could you elaborate?\n* The assumption that the reward is normalized between 0 and 1 -- is this taken into account in the experiments?\n* The sentences 193-195 are unclear, could you clarify?\n* Eq. 11: x \\in R^d is this d overloaded?\n* Eq. 11: what is B_c? The ball with radius c? It looks like c is not defined.\n* Eq. 12: Does M(B_c) mean the space of probability distributions over the ball with radius c?\n* Lemma 3 assumes a stationary distribution over states, but this distribution changes as the policy changes. How does this influence the theory/results?\n* Figure 1: what is magnitude? The magnitude of the embedding?\n\n### Minor comments:\n* Below are some suggested references on state representation learning that could be relevant to include in related work.\n* Plots are hard to read in black and white\n* While the motivation for requiring more informative rewards is clear (as mentioned in strengths), it is not motivated why this takes the form of intrinsic rewards, as compared to e.g. reward propagation. \n* SAC does not fail in sparse-cartpole with N_m=1, it just takes longer to converge\n\n\n### Overall:\n\nThe score is mostly based on the following:\n* The choice of inverse dynamics (vs action-dependent contrastive coding or another type of auxiliary loss) should be properly motivated, either theoretically or experimentally.\n* Missing references should be included\n* Evaluation should be performed on the same benchmarks as DBC, e.g. with natural video distraction.\n\nI would raise the score if these are addressed.\n\n#### Missing references:\n* Biza et al, \"Online Abstraction with MDP Homomorphisms for Deep Learning\"\n* Grimm et al, \"The value equivalence principle for model-based reinforcement learning\"\n* Le Lan et al, \"Metrics and continuity in reinforcement learning\"\n* Ravindran & Barto, \"Approximate Homomorphisms: A framework for non-exact minimization in Markov Decision Processes\"\n* Taylor et al, \"Bounding Performance Loss in Approximate MDP Homomorphisms\"\n* Van der Pol et al, \"Plannable Approximations to MDP homomorphisms: equivariance under actions\"\n\n#### Suggested references\n* Agarwal et al, \"Contrastive Behavioral Similarity Embeddings for Generalization in Reinforcement Learning\"\n* Corneil et al,  \u201cEfficient model-based deep reinforcement learning with variational state tabulation\u201d\n* Dadashi et al, Offline Reinforcement Learning with Pseudometric Learning\n* Francois-Lavet et al, \u201cCombined reinforcement learning via abstract representations\u201d\n* Watter et al,  \u201cEmbed to control: A locally linear latent dynamics model for control from raw images\u201d\n\n#### Update\nThank you for the rebuttal, and for the update on the experiments. I think adding the new experiments to the paper will make the paper more convincing. \nWhen reviewing, I only had a few issues with this paper: the lack of motivation for the choice of inverse dynamics (as opposed to another auxiliary loss), the missing evaluations on benchmarks with natural video distractions (for a fair comparison to DBC), the somewhat limited scope (due to the focus on DBC), some missing references, and the paper not being fully self-contained.\nIn the author response, the authors motivate their choice of inverse dynamics, clarify that their results can be useful for bisimulation metric learning in general, promise to add the references and amend the paper where it is unclear, and in a second reply give an update on benchmarks with natural video distractions, with positive results. \n\nThe authors thus address my original concerns. However, reviewer pEeB raised concerns about the theoretical analysis that are important to address. I have therefore decided keep my original score.\n",
    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their time and detailed feedback. The reviewer highlighted that they found our paper to be well-written with an easy-to-follow and informative theoretical section. We are also glad to see they described our analysis of issues with DBC as having clear added value.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- Motivation for the use of inverse dynamics and its evaluation: We agree with the reviewer that the representation learning literature has a rich variety of powerful methods, which could potentially replace the inverse dynamics (ID) regularizer. Indeed, as noted in the Limitations section (L340), the use of intrinsic rewards (IR) and ID are not necessarily theoretically optimal, in the bisimulation metric context. However, we nevertheless felt that ID was a natural choice for our choice of setting (sparse rewards and high distraction). First, ID is naturally robust to observational distractors, as predicting the action in the presence of distraction requires learning to ignore irrelevant information (e.g., [2]). Second, given an encoder, the ID method is computationally efficient, with only light overhead (as $g_I$ is relatively small). Third, since it does not rely on the reward signal, it may still provide a useful representation even in the sparse-reward scenario, preventing embedding pathology. Indeed, Pathak et al. [27] utilize ID in conjunction with IR, in sparse-reward environments with additional distractors, suggesting it is a proven approach under such conditions. Regarding auxiliary losses, while contrastive losses avoid reconstruction, Zhang et al [36] find that such approaches are less robust than DBC. More sophisticated techniques, such as action-dependent CPC, may very well overcome such issues. However, we chose to focus on ID, for the reasons above, and leave further investigation of the optimal embedding regularizer to future work, noting our approach did improve significantly over DBC.\n\n- Limited scope due to focus on DBC: we agree that our model architecture and training algorithm build heavily on DBC and that the potential weaknesses of DBC have inspired a significant portion of this work. However, we would like to remark that our main theoretical results in Theorems 1-4 are broadly applicable to bisimulation metric learning whether or not the DBC algorithm in particular is used for training. We hope that these will inspire future work with new algorithms and architectures by extending the community\u2019s understanding of bisimulation in general and on-policy bisimulation.\n\n- We will add the following information to the manuscript to improve readability: \n\n   - A compact subset of S is one that is totally bounded and complete. \n   - The diameter of a state space is the maximum distance between any two states measured via a distance function (see Lemma 1).\n   - $\\sup$ is the supremum.\n   - $\\mathrm{supp}(p)$ is the support of the distribution of $p$.\n   - $\\mathcal{H}$ denotes entropy, i.e., the expected Shannon information content.\n   - Statistical dispersion is an umbrella term used to describe measures of variability (e.g., variance). \n\n- We will add the following metric learning papers for reference to discussion of collapse and explosion issues:\n\n   - Hermans, Alexander, Lucas Beyer, and Bastian Leibe. \"In defense of the triplet loss for person re-identification.\"\n\n   - Schroff, Florian, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin. \"Facenet: A unified embedding for face recognition and clustering.\"\n\n   - Wu, Chao-Yuan, R. Manmatha, Alexander J. Smola, and Philipp Krahenbuhl. \"Sampling matters in deep embedding learning.\"\n\n- While the reviewer is correct that a completely collapsed embedding will not provide useful intrinsic rewards, the goal is to utilize such rewards to prevent such a collapse in the first place, by allowing the bisimulation metric to differentiate between states, based on the agent's surprise. In addition, the use of inverse dynamics (ID) regularization, is designed to prevent collapse directly (by requiring the embedded vectors to solve an independent task); this may also have the effect of ensuring the IR remains functional as well.\n\n- We agree that the non-stationarity of the reward could cause more of an issue in more complex environments. Our assumption is that, even for more complicated tasks, the agent will eventually begin to better predict the world. This is made more plausible by the fact that the agent need not be able to predict full observations, but rather need only predict embeddings that are specifically designed to care only about task (and/or action) related information. We additionally note that the IR clamped maximum $R_{\\mathrm{max},I}$, as well as the IR weight scale coefficient $\\eta_r$, are both used to preserve stability by ensuring the IR does not overwhelm the agent.\n\n- Regarding the completeness of the ablation study, the reviewer correctly notes that \u201cDBC-ID and DBC-normed-ID are not included\u201d in the ablation analysis. We found DBC-ID and DBC-normed-ID to perform fairly similarly to DBC and DBC-normed, respectively. We will include these additional settings in the plots for the final version.\n\n- Comment on Fig.3: we will replace \u201con par\u201d with \u201cslightly below\u201d.\n\n- Natural video distractions: following the reviewer\u2019s recommendation, we are currently performing experiments for DMC with natural video distractions in the background. We have obtained preliminary results on the cheetah-run task, which show better results compared to both SAC and DBC. We intend to add these experiments to the final manuscript.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- Via the recursive relation induced by the bisimilarity transition distance term, differences in rewards in the future affect bisimilarity, although to a reduced extent. Here $c_T$ serves a role analogous to a discount factor.\n\n- Yes, $R \\in [0, 1]$ will be added to the experiments section. \n \n- L193-195: Our remarks on L193-195 concern the common choice to assign the value of $\\gamma$ to $c_T$. Both coefficients can be viewed as timescales: $\\gamma$ defines the timescale of future rewards that the agent considers, while $c_T$ controls the effect of the recursive, forward-looking term in the bisimulation distance versus that of the immediate reward difference. Higher $c_T$ thus emphasizes the difference in the distribution of future states - shifting the \u201ctimescale\u201d of the metric on states to be less myopic. While $\\gamma$ is a property of the MDP, $c_T$ controls the learned representation; it is not obvious a priori that these two time-scales, therefore, should be identical. Indeed, decoupling them can be helpful to performance (L192). Lines 193-195 speculate that the state representation, given appropriate training, can hold information about rewards and dynamics relevant to both time scales, and that it is not necessary to set them equal to each other, as most prior methods do. We will endeavour to better clarify this in the paper. \n\n- Thanks, $d$ will be replaced with $n$ to avoid overloading.\n\n- $\\mathbb{B}_c$ denotes \u201cclosed\u201d ball (will be clarified). $\\mathcal{M}(\\mathbb{B}_c)$ is the space of distributions over it, given radius in Eq. 11. \n\n- Stationary distribution assumption in Lemma 3: \n\n   - The reviewer correctly notes that the stationary distribution in Lemma 3 is policy-dependent, and hence changes as training proceeds. \nIndeed, the lemma assumes a fixed policy, and thus computes its expectations over a fixed stationary distribution.\nIf the agent sees states sampled from a different distribution, whether due to non-stationarity of the policy or some other reason, then the statistical relation in Lemma 3 may not be guaranteed to hold.\nNevertheless, empirically, we find that for simple MDPs on which we tested, the relation approximately holds despite the continuously changing policy, especially later in training. \nPotentially, this may be due to the learning process (i.e., rate of policy change) slowing down later in training, as the agent and its representation improves. The use of a replay buffer and Polyak updates also reduce the non-stationarity of the policy.\n\n- Yes, magnitude is the magnitude of the embedding as in y-axis labels.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- Thanks for pointing out, missing references will be added to related work.\n\n- We will try to alter the plots to improve visual accessibility with different dash types.\n\n- Motivation for intrinsic rewards (IR): as in the case of inverse dynamics mentioned previously, we do not wish to claim that curiosity-driven intrinsic rewards, based on forward model error, are the optimal approach to preventing embedding pathologies in the latent bisimulation metric space (e.g., as mentioned in Limitations, L340-341). However, given that sparse rewards are a cause of such problems, it seems natural that adding an informative intrinsic reward could be a potential solution. Furthermore, prior work has shown that such curiosity-based approaches to exploration have proven useful in sparse environments, including the case of high distraction [27], in which the bisimulation approach is designed to operate. In addition, since computing bisimulation distances already requires a forward model, there is minimal effect on computational efficiency from adding IR (L280-281). Nevertheless, other approaches of greater complexity, such as reward propagation via potential functions, may prove to be more effective. We will add further commentary on the potential of such alternative methods in the paper.\n\n- \u201ctop-middle and top-right\u201d will be replaced with \u201ctop-right\u201d. We will reword to say SAC fails under \u201cheavy\u201d distraction.\n",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their time and feedback. To ensure that the improvements introduced by our method carry over to more complex environments and dynamics, we performed experiments on the cheetah-run and cartpole-swingup-sparse tasks of the DeepMind Control Suite (see Fig. 3). These are 3D environments simulated in MuJoCo and the RL agent learns from raw pixel observations in these cases. In particular, the cheetah-run environment has complex dynamics, with an 18D state space for the simulated robot\u2019s joint positions and velocities, as well as a 6D action space (this information will be added to the final manuscript). We found that our improvements over DBC indeed carry over to this more complex task. \n\nThe DeepMind Control Suite offers a sparse-reward setting for a small subset of the available tasks including cartpole-swingup-sparse; unfortunately all of these tasks have simpler dynamics than tasks like cheetah-run and walker. While this task has simpler dynamics ($\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{S})=4, \\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{A})=1$) compared to cheetah-run, the task is relatively more challenging than cartpole-balance-sparse, since the pole starts in downright position. However, we agree with the reviewer that further evaluation on even more complex tasks, possibly real robots, would strongly complement the theoretical contributions of our work, which we left for future efforts.",

    "review": "Learning good latent representation is important for RL problems with high dimensional observations, and recent approaches based on bisimulation metrics have shown promising results. This paper analyzes the existence of unique on-policy bisimulation metrics and their connection to value function bounds. Based on the properties, the paper proposes a normalization method to fix some embedding issues of prior methods in sparse reward environments, and it further proposes improvements using intrinsic rewards and inverse dynamics.\n\nThe ideas to analyze on-policy bisumlation metrics is very reasonable, and the proposed methods seem to be both theoretical and practical appealing, but the paper (particular Section 3) is very difficult to read, and many key concepts are either missing or hard to follow. Below are some issues with the paper in the current status.\n\nAs the paper claimed, one of the key contributions is the convergence condition of bisimulation metric in learning. However, there is never a formal statement of what is the \"sufficient condition for the existence of a unique bisimulation metric\". This condition seems to be mentioned after Theorem 3, but the discussion is very confusing. From the statement of Theorem 3, \"the sufficient conditions\" seem to refer to cT<1, p=1, and the support of the approximate dynamics is closed. But later in (11) the main condition seems to refer to the boundedness of the metric. The boundedness of the unique metric is mentioned in Theorem 3, but as a property instead of a sufficient condition. After checking the proof of Theorem 3, the boundedness is indeed not used in proving the existence of the metric. So why does the boundedness of metric becomes the sufficient condition? Does the boundedness have any relationship to the closedness of the support? Even more confusing, in all discussions after Section 3 the condition is referred to \"embedding normalization\" without any definition nor explanation. Does normalization mean the requirements (11)? How does the normalization actually work in learning with parameterized embedding functions?\n\nThere are some missing definitions and typos which highly affect readability. There is no definition of the diameter before Lemma 1, no definition for the different forms of metrics used in Theorem 4 besides in the appendix. In the paragraph before Theorem 3, one metric d with hat but another one without hat. What is the metric d appearing in (11)? There is no indication on what the sup in (14) over on which doesn't seem to be over policies.\n\nThe idea of investigating the danger of on-policy bisimulation with sparse rewards in 3.2.3 is very interesting, but the discussion is very unclear and may need further explanation. The section claims that the challenges of degeneration is only an issue with on-policy bisimulation, but there is no comparison with policy-independent bisimulation. If policy-independent bisimulation doesn't have the issue, then why prior methods don't work? The paper also claims that this degeneration might be the reason for poor performance of DBC and the proposed methods fix the degeneration, but the simulation results actually show exploding behaviors instead of collapsing. How does the analysis explains exploding behaviors of DBC? The proposed intrinsic rewards and inverse dynamics methods seem reasonable, but there does not seem to have any connection to the analysis in 3.2.3 and why these methods can resolve the degeneration issue.\n\nAs said above, I like the ideas of the paper but would not recommend to accept it given the issues mentioned above. I will consider raising the score if the paper can be revised to address the above points.\n\n\n",
    "comment": "We are grateful to the reviewer for their detailed comments, and appreciate that they both \"like the ideas\" and feel the \"proposed methods seem to be both theoretical and practical appealing\".\n\n- Regarding sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique bisimulation metric, we will better clarify them and include the following information more clearly:\n\n  - The first mention of sufficient conditions for showing the existence of a unique bisimulation metric is in L132-134; one needs to ensure that the RHS is a contraction so that the Banach fixed point theorem can be applied. We also show how this proof unfolds in the proof of Remark 1 in Appendix B.\nBanach FP theorem requires that the space on which it is applied is \u201ccomplete\u201d. In this case, Banach FP theorem is applied on the space of metrics. To ensure that the space of metrics over states is complete, [11] showed that it is sufficient to assume that the state space itself is \u201ccompact\u201d.\nHowever, [11] was assuming ground-truth dynamics, which implied that unrolling the transition dynamics would result in future states also being in that same compact state space.\nUsing approximate dynamics, however, one needs to ensure that repeated application of transition dynamics $\\widehat{\\mathcal{P}}$ keeps the state in a compact space (i.e., ensuring bounded support), which leads us to Thm. 3.\n\n- > \"So why does the boundedness of metric becomes the sufficient condition?\"\n\n   - We differentiate between two conditions: (C1) the implication proven in Thm. 3, which shows that the support of $\\widehat{\\mathcal{P}}$ being contained in $\\mathcal{S}$ is *sufficient* for metric uniqueness and existence and (C2) boundedness of the metric (a property of any BSM, as in Eq. 9, and enforced by us via Eq. 11, which is *necessary* to satisfy the (sufficient) condition (C1). Thus boundedness itself is not the sufficient condition referred to in L210, but it is necessary for it.\n\n   - Regarding the relation to our embedding normalization technique, Thm. 3 shows that (assuming the forward model outputs valid states in $\\mathcal{S}$) the optimal metric derived from using that approximate forward model must be bounded according to Eq. 9 in Lemma 1. Hence, if we obtain a learned metric that is *not* bounded, then it is necessarily *not* the optimal metric for the given approximate dynamics. In other words, the contrapositive of the theorem tells us that boundedness (wrt Eq. 9) is necessary for correctness of the learned metric.\nThis helps motivate our \u201cembedding normalization\u201d technique. Assuming that $\\mathcal{S}$ is compact (and thus bounded), the true metric is bounded by Eq. 9. Hence, any learned or approximate metric that violates this bound cannot be the correct metric, and should be removed from the \u201csolution space of metrics\u201d (L211). Thus, we use our normalization technique to ensure that this bound is satisfied.  \n\n- > \"Does the boundedness have any relationship to the closedness of the support?\"\n\n   - Yes, a closed subset of a bounded space is also bounded. Secondly, a closed subset of a compact space is also compact. \n\n- Regarding \"embedding normalization\", we would like to differentiate between (i) the desired property of the support of the forward model to be bounded when $\\mathcal{S}$ is compact, compared to (ii) the technique we use to enforce the satisfaction of this property. Indeed, Eq. 11 is our technique for doing so. Thus, the normalization does indeed mean Eq. 11, but the actual condition we wish to satisfy is in Eq. 10, using our method given in Eq. 11. As to how this technique works with parameterized embedding functions, we simply use the Euclidean norm of the embedded vectors, including the normalization as part of the forward pass of the encoder.\n\n- Missing definitions and typos:\n\n   - Regarding the missing definitions, thank you, they will be added to the paper.  \n   - \"In the paragraph before Thm. 3, one metric $d$ with hat but another one without hat.\" The hat signifies the estimated (learned) metric, while the one without is the ground truth. We will add additional clarification text.\n   - The metric appearing in Eq. 11 is the learned Euclidean metric in the embedding phi space, which approximates the bisimulation metric. We will alter the text to clarify.\n   - The supremum in Eq. 14 is over pairs of per-state expected rewards (or, equivalently, over $i,j$). We will clarify the notation.\n\n- Regarding the danger of on-policy bisimulation:\n\n  - While policy-independent bisimulation does not necessarily have the same embedding issues, it introduces separate difficulties. In particular, it results in computational tractability challenges, as estimating the metric becomes too difficult for continuous action spaces due to the max operation. Further, as noted in our refs [7,8], policy-independent BSMs can be unnecessarily pessimistic (e.g., poor actions that no reasonable policy would choose can still greatly affect the state metric).\n\n-  > \"How does the analysis explains exploding behaviors of DBC? \" \n\n   - One theoretical reason for embedding explosions is the presence of a $1 / (1-c_T)$ term in the expected value of the distance, which can be seen in Eq. 16. Since we often set $c_T = \\gamma \\approx 1$, this term tends to amplify the distances and norms of the metric during learning. This is further discussed in more detail in Appendix C. We will move some of this explanation into the main paper.\n\n   - Another reason is the violation of the compactness condition by an approximate dynamics model as discussed in Sec 3.2.3. For example, consider an erroneous dynamics model that doubles the embedding space volume after each timestep. In such a case, due to the recursive definition of the bisimulation metric, pairwise distances between states will also grow after each fixed-point iteration, which may result in explosion. \n\n- > \"The proposed intrinsic rewards and inverse dynamics methods seem reasonable, but there does not seem to have any connection to the analysis in 3.2.3 and why these methods can resolve the degeneration issue.\"\n\n   - We briefly motivate the connection of IR and ID to the analysis on L260-262: \"These observations motivate us to extend the method with inverse dynamics-based regularization and intrinsic rewards based on forward prediction errors (see Sec 3.3), since they promote $\\mu^\\pi_{bd}, \\mu^\\pi _{rd} > 0$ respectively.\" Intuitively, the numerical embedding pathologies stem from uninformative rewards: adding IR should mitigate this root problem directly, though it assumes (as many curiosity-based works do) that exploration rewards can provide a useful representation. ID, on the other hand, provides a reward-independent regularization of the latent space, which has proven to provide a useful representation for distracted and sparse-reward environments in prior work [2,27]. Our motivation is that, even in the presence of uninformative rewards, the regularized embedding will still contain useful information. We will add further clarification of this to the paper.",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their comments, which highlighted that our work was found to be significant to the community, novel, well-written and easy to follow. Below, we respond to individual questions:\n\n1. Collapse vs. exploration: poor exploration may cause embedding collapse unless precautions are taken; in sparse reward environments, if an agent fails to explore the environment, it may never encounter a positive reward. This results in the rewards being uninformative/low-dispersion (e.g., all zeros), which leads to collapse due to the structure of the on-policy bisimulation metric. Lemma 3 characterizes this notion mathematically, showing a linear relationship between dispersion and average distance. This motivates our use of intrinsic rewards to improve exploration and thus increase robustness to collapse. \n\n2. Our final experiments with the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) are indeed MuJoCo environments. The cartpole-swingup-sparse environment of DMC has sparse rewards as the name suggests, and we observe the same tendency of DBC to struggle in this case. In particular, while our method reaches 200 total evaluation rewards in ~200K steps, DBC takes more than 2x as many timesteps to reach this mark. Note also that the RL agents here work with raw pixel observations (i.e., high-dimensional input) to represent observations/states. Our findings from these experiments are consistent with our findings from Fig. 2.\n\n3. While one might argue that the slight differences between our approach and SAC in Fig. 3 (cartpole-swingup-sparse) might be due to randomness (highly overlapping shaded areas), we would like to note that SAC is a generally efficient algorithm, while DBC and our approach specifically aim to be robust/invariant to noise and distractors. As such, the DBC paper showed that DBC outperforms strong baselines under heavy distraction, but their results showed that it performed sub-par without distractions (i.e., worse than non-bisimulation-based baselines, as we also observe in the DMC tasks). Here, despite a lack of distractions, our method's performance is competitive with SAC and significantly above DBC, indicating that we remedy DBC\u2019s apparent weakness under low-distraction conditions, thus extending its scope of applicability. We will update the manuscript to further clarify this point. We also note that, following reviewer mSYo\u2019s recommendation, we are currently performing experiments for DMC with natural video distractions in the background. We have obtained preliminary results on the cheetah-run task, which show better results compared to both SAC and DBC. We intend to add these experiments to the final manuscript.",

    "review": "\n1. To achieve the main result, a useful Lemma 3.1 is shown (this is a minor variation of a Lemma from BKZ): this result avoids the sampling error term $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ by showing a moment bound of a \"shifted\" generalization error. This shifting includes the risk of the algorithm output and an average conditional loss. It would be interesting if the authors would elaborate further about the intuition on this refinement, and what are its consequences for the excess risk bounds (the technical proofs are clear, but \nnevertheless it might be useful a brief discussion).\n\n2. The proof of the main result (Thm 1.1) is obtained nontrivially from Lemma 3.1. This involves a (seemingly novel) decomposition of the excess risk and the (shifted) generalization error, along with various estimates based on concentration by the Bernstein condition.\n\n3. Theorem 1.2 provides what they call a variance-type bound (not sure why is it called like this), which bounds the risk in terms of the empirical risk and a deviation bound which leverages faster rates by uniform stability. This bound seems useful in realizable settings, where the empirical risk can be made arbitrarily small.\n\n4. The consequences for strongly convex stochastic optimization appear in Proposition 2.1 and its following discussion. As mentioned above, this general bound for stable algorithms answers a question raised in Shalev-Shwartz et al (2009) which is quite interesting on its own. In this result, the most problematic term is $\\sqrt{L^2\\overline{\\Delta}/\\lambda}$, where $\\overline{\\Delta}$ is a bound on the empirical error: this leads to optimal excess risk in this case for GD with O(n^2) iterations. It is worth pointing out here that a similar iteration requirement appears in the nonsmooth case, as shown in Bassily, Feldman Guzman and Talwar (2020). That paper also includes a lower bound on stability, showing that for GD $\\Omega(n^2)$ steps needed to obtain optimal rates with uniform stability. It is reasonable to conjecture that a similar lower bound may hold in the strongly convex setting, and in fact some limitations of GD in terms of excess risk have already been shown in recent work by Amir, Koren and Livni (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01117.pdf). The latter result is shown for GD on the regularized ERM, but I suspect ideas there might be useful for the strongly convex setting as well.\n\nFinally, I would suggest the authors to include a more detailed statement of the last paragraph before section 3 (lines 204-206 in page 6). Here it is claimed a new high-probability excess risk bound for GD on smooth and strongly convex losses. For future use of this result, it might be a good idea to have a proper statement.\n",
    "comment": "\"Deviation optimal\" refers mainly to the bound from Proposition 2.1, although rather ambitiously we ignore the logarithmic term. The lower bound $\\Omega(\\log(1/\\delta)/n)$ is a standard excess risk lower bound for strongly convex losses (one may consider $d = 1, X = 1$ a.s., then $(y - w)^2$ is strongly convex with respect to $w$ whenever $Y$ is equal to $\\pm L$ with probability $1/2$ respectively. In this case, ERM is a sample mean estimator and its excess risk is $\\Omega(\\log(1/\\delta)/n)$. We will add a comment and a reference on this. Lemma 3.1 as a probabilistic statement that is also sharp up to a logarithmic factor as the lower bound of Proposition 9 in (BKZ) shows.\n\nWe call it the variance-type bound because of the equivalent form presented in equation (12). The second moment of the risk is bounded there by the term $MR(w_n)$. This notion is quite standard for the bounds based on the Bernstein inequality.\n\nThanks a lot, we were not aware of the recent work of Amir, Koren and Livni (2021) and some of the details of Bassily, Feldman, Guzman and Talwar (2020). We will add this discussion and references in the updated text. It is indeed very plausible that $\\Omega(n^2)$ steps are needed in the strongly convex, non-smooth case.\n\nThank you for this suggestion, we will expand the discussion of the strongly convex smooth case in the final version.",

The main idea of proof is to make a smart use of an extended bounded difference inequality from Bousquet, et al. (2020) to separate the sampling term from the generalization error, so that the randomness of model and data sample can be decoupled in a way that the Bernstain inequality is applicable to get tighter bounds. While built largely upon the previous results, IMO the technical part still appears novel enough in the considered problem regime.  \n \n+ The paper is generally well organized and clearly presented, with all steps in the proofs very carefully explained. \n\nWeakness: \n  \n   My main concern is about the benefit of main results in Theorem 1.1 when substantialized to ERM and PGD with arbitrary convex losses. Basically, the improved $O(\\frac{\\log(n)}{n})$ rate of convergence seems only possible for strongly convex loss functions with zero optimization error achievable over training data. For generic convex losses which are of more interest in practice, we usually need to deal with regularized ERM of which the empirical risk error $\\Delta_{opt}$ is typically $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$ due to a trade-off between optimization and generalization. In this case, while the population risk can still be assumed strongly convex so that Theorem 1.1 is applicable, the $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$ optimization error term will dominate the risk bound which makes the  $O(\\frac{1}{n})$ term much less interesting. The authors have partially  addressed such a limitation for Theorem 1.2 with respect to the empirical risk. However, it looks like that similar or even more severe limitations exist for Theorem 1.1 as well in terms of optimization error.  \n\n\n=== Post rebuttal update ===\n\nThe major concern  on the limitation of results raised in my initial review has been properly addressed in author response. I would like to maintain my rating.   ",
    "comment": "Thank you for the detailed review. General convex losses are indeed of greater practical interest. However, we respectfully disagree that the fact that our improvements are not very useful in this setup is the weakness of our work. In particular, there are fundamental limitations for achieving the rates faster than $O(1/\\sqrt n)$ for general convex Lipschitz losses (for some high probability bounds achieving this rate, see the work of Feldman and Vondrak, 2019), whereas we focus on getting $O(1/n)$ high probability bounds whenever it is theoretically possible. We also remark that for strongly convex losses the improved convergence rates work if the optimization error is small but not necessarily zero (see Section 2.3). Finally, we briefly discuss possible applications in the non-strongly convex cases (see last paragraph of Section 2.1).",

    "comment": "Thank you, it is a good question about the relatively large $O(n^2)$ number of iterations in the non-smooth case. We believe that without the smoothness assumption not much can be improved. In particular, very recently Amir, Koren and Livni (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01117.pdf) considered the problem of convex Lipschitz optimization with a quadratic regularization and showed that in this case, GD requires $\\Omega(n^2)$ steps (we thank the reviewer 4(1bRR) for pointing this out). In their Theorem 3.2 the term $\\sqrt{\\Delta / \\lambda}$ appears in the lower bound. Even though they consider a slightly different problem, this number of iterations might not be improvable in our case as well. \n\nAdditionally, see the discussions on strongly convex Lipschitz optimization problems in Section 2.",

    "review": "This is a paper to bring the technical of nested sampling that is well-used in physics and cosmology to the machine learning GP community. The paper is not very original and significant, given that nested sampling has been introduced previously in N(eur)IPS [Murray, 2005], and the authors of that paper have very deep knowledge of GP and are experts in this area. It is also widely accepted that margalised (or Bayesian) GP is *the correct* thing to to, though it can be somewhat challenging to execute in practice.\n\nNevertheless, this is a worthwhile paper, (re-)illustrating the significance of  Bayesian GP, esp in the context of the recently introduced spectral mixture kernel (SKM) which has multiple modes as illustrated by the authors. Also useful is to bring to attention the DYNESTY package. If the authors were to release their code, I can see that the code will be used frequently.\n\nSection 4 is a particularly helpful advice for anyone attempting to use SKM. The paper is also well-written.\n\n# Detailed comments\n1. I prefer the term \"Bayesian Gaussian Processes\" rather than \"Marginalised Gaussian Processes\" in the title, but this is a matter of personal preference.\n2. Given that the study is limited to SKM, this should be in the title.\n3. Reorganised the paper to put SMK material in section 2 together with section 4.\n4. It is paramount to cite and discuss [Murray, 2005].\n5. I beg to differ from the sentence from line 232  to 233. The pattern for NS is too clear on along the axis in Figure 4, and then it blurs out along the edges. This is not what the generating function gives. It is nevertheless reassuring that all these are better than NKN.\n6. Lines 262 to 263 tries to give something negative a positive light. What I read is that for simpler kernels/covariance-functions like the RBF/squared-exponential that are typically used in practice, there is no requirement for NS.\n7. Lines  284 to 286 requires a correct heading.\n\nIain Murray, David MacKay, Zoubin Ghahramani, John Skilling. Nested sampling for Potts models.

    "comment": "Thank you for the detailed comments, we try and address each of them below:\n\n1) Thank you for the suggestion - it is certainly a valid point and more well-known terminology. \n\n2) While the focus is on the Spectral Mixture kernel mainly to demonstrate the benefits of multimodal marginalisation we also include results for the RBF kernel under both sampling schemes in the time-series experiments, hence we chose to use \"with Nested Sampling\" in the title. We believe Nested Sampling could prove beneficial for other complex kernels such as those involving changepoints.  \n\n3) Agreed. \n\n4) We are certainly happy to include a mention of Murray's 2005 work on applying nested sampling to Potts models.\n\n5) Perhaps there has been a slight misunderstanding regarding the performance of ML-II in Figure 4. Here the sampling methods aren't just \"competitive with ML-II\", they significantly outperform it. Further, the plot only visualises the mean of the posterior predictive distribution (which is computed by averaging over several means for the sampling methods) rather than the posterior predictive samples. The *blurriness* indicates uncertainty captured by the posterior predictive samples in regions with sparse training data. In either case, the sampling methods yield a much more reasonable extrapolation compared to canonical ML-II which appears to introduce artefacts.\n\n6) For the particular tasks at hand, there is indeed little benefit to marginalisation of the simpler kernel - we will try to make this limitation more clear in the text. For more complex higher dimensional tasks, we anticipate there may still be considerable benefits to be found. \n\n7) We agree that including a heading would be beneficial here. \n\nThank you to the pointer to the Murray et al [2005] reference which will be included and discussed in related work.  We shall also clarify that the application to simpler kernels requires further study.\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for the pointer to Iain Murray's PhD thesis, which indeed contains an elegant review of the nested sampling algorithm. We still believe there to be considerable novelty in our work, in part due to the application of nested sampling to Gaussian Processes. We will also emphasise that the nested sampling algorithm has progressed dramatically over the past decade. Prior to the introduction of multinest (Feroz et al 2009), it was not feasible to perform nested sampling on higher dimensional multimodal spaces. We believe it is valuable to highlight these advancements to the ML community.\n\nWe report individual run-times per experiment (and averaged) for both methods HMC and Nested Sampling in the time-series experiment in Figure 6.\n\nWe agree it would be clearer to modify the paragraph starting on L137, and to include a more detailed explanation in the Appendix and clarification of the convergence criteria. For reference, the 'rslice' option is one of six sampling methods available in the dynesty package (the full set of options can be found at https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#sampling-options). \n\nWe will also clarify the notation in Algorithm 1 and fix the typing errors. \n",

    "review": "The paper addresses a problem of marginalizing GP hyperparameters. The proposed technique is nested sampling of the hyperparameters. Nested sampling (NS henceforth) was developed previuosly, however the application of the technique to GPs is original work. The authors thoroughly cite related work.\n\nThe work claims that NS improves GP behavior compared to a point estimate of the hyperparameters. On the other hand, NS takes significantly less computation time than exploring the posterior with HMC. Performance comparison between NS and HMC seems to depend largely on the kernel and the dataset. There is also a comparison with Neural Kernel Network. \nThe claims are supported by experiments. \n\nThe paper is very well-written and organized.

The SM kernel is indeed a very expressive family. \n\nOverall, very good paper.",
    "comment": "We are grateful for the positive feedback, we are pleased the manuscript was found to be valuable and well written. We will certainly address the highlighted issues regarding the typing errors and font sizes for captions. \n\nAs requested, we will elaborate on the justification for a uniform prior at frequencies above the fundamental. To very briefly summarise here - this stems from the effect of aliasing, where contributions from frequencies above the Nyquist frequency are projected down to below the Nyquist frequency. Hence, if the mean frequency has a broad prior $\\mu \\sim LogNormal[a, b]$ -> this ends up getting reduced to $\\mu  \\pmod{\\nu_N} $,  so the implied prior is approximately equivalent to a Uniform upper bounded at the Nyquist frequency.

    "comment": "Thank you very much for trusting us that the error is a typo rather than a formulation error. \n\nFor your concern about the statistical significance of our methods compared to other baselines, please see our latest comment to all reviewers titled \"Statistical Significant Performance\".\n\nFor static NE strategies baselines, we create one NE strategy as follow:\n\nGiven a parameter \\alpha in [0, 1/3], Player one chooses to bet with probability \\alpha when he has a Jack and checks otherwise. Then, when the other player bets he will always fold. Player one chooses to bet with probability 3*\\alpha when he has a King and checks otherwise. Then, when the other player bets he will always call. Player one will always check when he has a Queen. Then, when the other player bets after the check, he will call the probability (1/3+\\alpha) and fold otherwise. The second player has a single equilibrium strategy: He will always bet or call when he has a King. He will check if possible when he has a Queen, otherwise, he will call with the probability of 1/3. When having a Jack, he never calls and bets with the probability of 1/3.\n\nGiven the rule above, we create 4 sets of NE strategies by setting \\alpha equal to 0, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3 respectively. We present our results below where values in parentheses are stds taken over 20 random seeds.\n\nFor \\alpha = 0, the NE strategy can obtain exploitation to PPO, TRPO, A2C opponents at 0.038 (0.006), 0.028 (0.009), 0.056 (0.014) respectively.\n\nFor \\alpha = 0.2, the NE strategy can obtain exploitation to PPO, TRPO, A2C opponents at 0.048 (0.011), 0.030 (0.008), 0.090 (0.057) respectively.\n\nFor \\alpha = 0.25, the NE strategy can obtain exploitation to PPO, TRPO, A2C opponents at 0.045 (0.009), 0.031 (0.008), 0.084 (0.037) respectively.\n\nFor \\alpha = 1/3, the NE strategy can obtain exploitation to PPO, TRPO, A2C opponents at 0.038 (0.006), 0.022 (0.005), 0.068 (0.040) respectively.\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for taking time to review our work and providing detailed and insightful feedback.\n\nAddressing your questions:\n\n1. Relation to Bard et al. (2013): In Bard\u2019s work, they observed that explicit opponent modelling requires a large amount of computation and training data, which makes the online opponent modelling challenging. Therefore, they proposed to move the heavy computation offline and only perform light online inference by implicit opponent modelling. Specifically, they built a population of robust response policies offline by RNR and DNR methods and only infer the expected utilities given its opponent\u2019s behaviour and response policies online. Then they can do online adaptation via multi-armed bandit algorithms with online inferred expected utilities and a group of experts trained offline. However, as with previous works related to RNR, Bard did not consider the non-stationarity induced by adaptive opponents. For example, the opponent the agent encounters during the online test stage is still a trained opponent with a stationary policy. We know that value-based RL methods have no theoretical guarantee of convergence in non-stationary environments and often perform badly in non-stationary experiments too. Therefore, we think Bard\u2019s work may also suffer the same problem as they also rely on opponents being stationary so that they can have a sufficiently accurate estimation of the expected utilities of a portfolio of counter strategies. We appreciate you pointing out the relation of Bard\u2019s work to CEPSOM and will include the above discussion in our updated version.\n\n2. New baselines: We implemented SAM [10] and MCCFR[B] as other two baselines. Similar to BC, SAM has high exploitability when it is trained against a PPO opponent. Its exploitation to the PPO agent also varies greatly. Once a SAM agent is trained, we test it against new adaptive opponents. When facing PPO, TRPO and A2C agents, it can only achieve -0.271 (0.167), -0.298 (0.105), -0.259 (0.171) exploitation respectively. This is slightly better than normal BC as SAM can effectively switch between two opponent models but is still very limited. Because all other baselines have no direct access to their opponent\u2019s policy, to have a relatively fair comparison, we adopt the Monte Carlo sampling version of CFR. However, even in this setting, MCCFR still has advantages as it can query its opponent to sample actions for its update which is not allowed in our other experiments. We did not consider a self-play version of CFR as we know it has similar performance to PSRO, i.e. converge to Nash equilibrium strategy, so it will not add extra information. MCCFR trained against adaptive PPO can reduce its exploitability to a relatively low level (0.28) but is limited to exploit the PPO opponent, especially considering that we only evaluate how much a baseline can exploit the PPO opponent after every time the PPO is updated. We also test trained MCCFR against new adaptive opponents including new PPO, TRPO, and A2C and it can only achieve exploitation of  -0.171 (0.162), -0.106 (0.108), 0.08 (0.141) respectively. We will update Figure 2 including the learning dynamics of these two new baselines against PPO opponents in our paper.\n\n3. Computational complexity: The computational complexity of our algorithm can be considered in three parts: 1. learning of an opponent model 2. learning of a best response policy to a prediction by the opponent model 3. solving the meta-game for RNR solutions by linear programming. In complex environments, to have relatively accurate models, the computational complexity of the first two parts is mainly affected by the number of data points we used during the training and is polynomial of the number of data points. Solving RNR solutions by a linear program (LP) is in polynomial time of the meta-game size. As done in [A], we could move most computationally heavy parts (1 and 2) offline. When we need to play against non-stationary opponents at test time, we would then only need to do light opponent inference and solve RNR solutions for the meta-level game online.\n\n4. Experimental evaluation: We apologise that we do not fully understand your question. You mentioned that \u201c...without any statistical analysis of the confidence intervals\u201d. We believe presenting empirical results with standard deviations of sample data obtained from different random seeds is a common approach used in the current machine learning community. Therefore, it may not be fair to say we do not have any statistical analysis because we do not present confidence intervals. If you were to mean that 5 random seeds are not enough, we have rerun all experiments whose results presented in Figure 2 and Table 1 with extra 20 random seeds and our conclusions drawn from these results remain the same as before. The values in our figures and tables will be updated accordingly in the next version of our paper with these 20 random seeds. We admit our test environment is very simple, however, we think having an algorithm to work well on the problem we focused on is not easy. Our problem is challenging because 1. We can only observe opponent history trajectories and knowledge of the opponent's learning characteristics is very limited. 2. We not only require our algorithm to learn a good approximate nash strategy but also be able to exploit a set of sub-optimal opponents much better than the Nash strategy. 3.Our agent does not need extra training at test time. However, opponents during training and test time are both allowed to learn and adapt and opponents encountered in test time can use different learning algorithms from opponents\u2019 in training time 4. We only evaluate our agent exploitation to an opponent every time after the opponent just updates its policy where we often observe that the exploitation is lowest in the period between which our agent just updates and the opponent just updates. To the best of our knowledge, we do not see many works satisfying all the above requirements.\n\n[B] Marc Lanctot, Kevin Waugh, Martin Zinkevich, and Michael Bowling. 2009.

    "review": "Initial reflection for context: The paper addresses an old problem that has, from my perspective, been re-hashed repeatedly over the last several decades.  Despite being foundational and somewhat simple, the answers remain extremely difficult and hard to come by (I argue that the problem itself is ill-posed).  It is within this view that I base my review.\n\nStrengths:\n\n+ The paper is, for the most part, well-written and polished.  The technical description of the algorithm is detailed and seems solid (albeit I found the algorithm description difficult to follow).\n\n+ I really like the two measures the paper analyzes: ability to exploit and exposure to exploitation.  This trade-off is central to the problem at hand.  (I expound on this a bit in the weaknesses portion of the paper).\n\n+ For the empirical results that are presented, the algorithm appears to perform well.  The results are limited, and in some sense can be viewed as simply anecdotal.  However, I also do not want to diminish the strength of this contribution, as getting an algorithm to do this even in this limited context is no small accomplishment.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- I read the results differently than how they are discussed in the text of the paper (which seems to be bent on advocating, perhaps understandably so, for the algorithm presented in the paper).  To me, the key insight of the paper is the trade-off between exploitability and exploitation.  I\u2019m not sure what the ideal trade-off between these measures is, but we could (for example) weight them equally.   If we do that, Figure 2 clearly shows that exploitability has higher magnitude across the algorithms than does exploitation.  If we simply subtract exploitability from exploitation, it appears to me that only PSRO has a positive value, suggesting it may be the best algorithm in this case among the 5 presented (though, again, the trade-off assessment of equal value between the metrics is subjective).  In the second set of results shown in Table 1, a similar trend continues, except that CEPSOM also has positive weight.  But the results don\u2019t seem to be telling me that CEPSOM necessarily obtains a better trade-off than PSRO (which is essentially minimax in this game, as I understand it).\n\n- In all honesty, it is hard to make any general assessment about EPSOM and CEPSOM from these limited results.  Is there some opponent that could really exploit CEPSOM.  If so, when and how?  If not, when and how?  The authors state at the outset of the paper that they are not interested in self play.  But self play is a foundational comparison in this domain, as any good algorithm would be adopted by other agents over time necessitating a successful algorithm to be good (in some sense) in self play.  But modeling copies of one\u2019s self is often problematic.\n\n- I do not understand Figure 3.\n\nAgain, this topic has been addressed for decades now, and I don\u2019t know that we are any closer now to solving the problem than we were decades ago.  Perhaps that is because the problem itself is, in a loose sense, ill-posed \u2014 claiming algorithms are better than each other in this domain with trade-offs are largely subjective.  That is why I like the set of metrics (exploitation and exploitability) present in this paper \u2014 it looks at the (messy) trade-off of the problem.  I wish the authors had taken that trade-off further in their analysis.  If they are will to do that, I can envision the paper as a worthy contribution.\n",
    "comment": "Thank you for taking time to review our work and providing detailed and insightful feedback. We are glad that you found the underlying idea behind EPSOM interesting and understand how challenging the problem is. We believe the trade-off between exploitation and exploitability is an important topic in competitive multi-agent problems. Many prior works [3,9,18,19,21] have also studied this topic so we cannot take all the credit for providing the trade-off analysis. Our contribution to this topic is that we take into account the non-stationarity induced by opponents when we try to optimise for this trade-off. Most prior works only consider how to exploit one stationary opponent while keeping the agent itself with low exploitability. However, in realistic settings, we need to consider how to exploit opponents which change over time while maintaining low exploitability. Changes can come from opponents also having the ability to learn and adapt or opponents that are different in different tournaments or both. Therefore, our work extends previous works to the non-stationarity setting which is more realistic and therefore more significant to the progress of research in this area.\n\nAddressing your questions:\n\n1. Interpretation of our results: In our experiments, we mainly want to show that (C)EPSOM can exploit non-stationary opponents while maintaining a low exploitability policy. In Figure 2 we can see that (C)EPSOM achieves similar exploitation when facing an adaptive PPO opponent as BC does but without sacrificing exploitability. In Table 1 we show that, once trained, (C)EPSOM can still exploit other adaptive opponents different from the ones (C)EPSOM encountered during the training without any further training. \n2. Difference between exploitation and exploitability: The exploitation is specific to a given opponent and measures how much a policy can exploit the given opponent. The exploitability only considers the worst case and measures how exploitable a policy is. Firstly, given an opponent, the difference between the two terms lacks a straightforward interpretable meaning. Secondly, if we weigh the two terms equally, the difference cannot tell us generally how good an algorithm is. When facing an opponent with a randomly initialised policy, EPSOM, CEPSOM and PSRO can achieve exploitation of 0.668, 0.739 and 0.276 respectively. When we subtract their exploitability reported in Table 1 from the above exploitation, we can see (C)EPSOM has significant advantages over PSRO. However, a randomly initialised opponent is rare in real tournaments. Therefore, if we try to calculate the difference between them, we should take the expectation of these terms with respect to the probability that we will encounter the given opponent and the worst-case opponent respectively. Then this requires us first to define the sample space. Focusing on a specific tournament with a limited number of opponents or the whole opponent policy space can greatly affect the result. Therefore, how to correctly calculate the difference between exploitation and exploitability is not an easy problem and beyond the focus of our work.  \n\n3. Is CEPSOM exploitable by other opponents?: As we can see from Table 1, the lowest exploitability CEPSOM can obtain is 0.08. This value is positive which means CEPSOM is exploitable. However, to truly exploit CEPSOM, one must disable CEPSOM\u2019s ability to adjust its meta-strategy according to its opponent model\u2019s prediction. In this case, CEPSOM must then play the safest strategy (one with the lowest exploitability). Otherwise, when an opponent tries to exploit CEPSOM it will render itself exploitable too. CEPSOM may then spot its weakness and in turn exploit the opponent. Due to CEPSOM\u2019s flexibility to adjust its meta-strategy, it is not easy for an opponent to exploit it for a long time.\n\n4. Better trade-off than PSRO: Trained (C)EPSOM maintains a population of policies and an opponent model which can predict the encountered opponent and adjust its response strategy based on the prediction and the prediction uncertainty. To empirically assess (C)EPSOM's performance, we select a set of typical strong opponents such as PPO, TRPO and A2C (added in the updated paper following review) and weak opponents such as a randomly initialised opponent. (C)EPSOM can exploit all of them to a greater extent than PSRO while only having slightly higher exploitability. The advantage of (C)EPSOM against one type of opponent over PSRO may not be significant but the total benefit will accumulate when an agent faces an increasing diversity of opponents while our (C)EPSOM\u2019s exploitability remains low and constant. Therefore, we believe (C)EPSOM has a better trade-off than PSRO.\n",

We all know metrics like FID and IS only tell a very coarse story, but the submission does not really analyze the properties of the resulting architecture. How does it build the pictures? How is its functionality different from existing main types of model architectures. For instance, compare to the attention map visualizations and composiotionality studies of Hudson and Zitnick that I found very illuminating.\n\nThe paper claims a record FID=31.87 and IS=21.32 for unconditional 128x128 ImageNet synthesis. I believe this to be incorrect: the BigBiGAN paper (Donahue and Simonyan, Large Scale Adversarial Representation Learning, NeurIPS 2019) presents an unconditional 128x128 model (\"no \\mathcal{E} (GAN)\" in Table 1) with FID=30.91 and IS=23.56. The claim of \"outperforming previous ConvNet-based models with a notable margin\" (L235) does not appear to be justified.\n\nOverall, I find image synthesis architectures fascinating, and that the quest for how to best do it is definitely unsolved. While it is interesting that the problem can be solved using all-attention architectures, I am not convinced by arguments that rely solely on metric numbers without analysis of the model's properties (\"what makes it tick\"). Moreover, the best results here are presented on aligned face datasets that are known to function well on existing architectures. I would be more convinced seeing high-quality results on more complex datasets, supported also by analysis other than FID and IS.\n\nSmaller comments:\n\nThe dimensions have been chosen quite poorly in Fig. 2; I find it impossible to understand without consulting the text. The choice of b=2 does not match well with the choice of 4x4 inputs, as dimension=2 is now overloaded.\n\nThe authors do not present visualizations of the attention maps and how they relate to the synthesis results.\n\nAll synthesis results in Fig. 3 show serious aliasing artifacts. I suspect that the ImageNet dataset has been preprocessed incorrectly when downsizing to 128^2, a common error due to the poor design choices in current deep learning frameworks. (Note that e.g. TORCH.NN.FUNCTIONAL.INTERPOLATE does *not* perform correct filtering when downsampling; comparing its output to e.g. PIL.Image.resize with resample=PIL.Image.BICUBIC or Matlab's imresize will reveal clear differences.)",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer\u2019s positive feedback and detailed recognition of our contribution. We address the questions raised by the reviewer below to improve the clarity of our paper.\n\n1. __What is a good noise injection method in Transformer-based generators?__ In our initial experiments, we find that compared with cross-attention, using the AdaIN and modulated layers for Transformer-based generators requires much higher memory cost during model training, which usually leads to out-of-memory errors when the model is trained for generating high-resolution images. As a result, related work like ViT-GAN, which uses AdaIN and modulated layers, can only produce images up to the resolution of $64 \\times 64$. Hence, we believe cross-attention is a better choice for high-resolution generators based on Transformers. We will clarify this point in the final version.\n\n2. __Experiments on large-scale datasets.__ We believe our results on ImageNet $128 \\times 128$ can demonstrate the performance of the proposed HiT on large-scale datasets. We are not able to finish the experiments on LSUN-cats and LSUN-cars given the limited time during the rebuttal period. We will add the relevant results in the final version.\n\n3. __Why self-attention modules in low-resolution stages are enough?__ This is because the low-resolution stages of HiT focus on encoding the structures of images which can benefit from capturing long-range dependencies by using self-attention modules. Instead, high-resolution stages generate image local details so long-range dependencies become less important. This can be demonstrated from Table 6 of the original paper, where we can see that the performance gain achieved by self-attention decreases along with the increase of feature resolutions. Therefore, we drop self-attention modules in high-resolution stages to boost the model efficiency of HiT. We will provide a detailed explanation for this part in the final version as suggested.",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer\u2019s instructive comments. Below are our responses to the points raised by the reviewer. We sincerely hope these will help improve the clarity of the paper and help the reviewer to finalize the judgment.\n\n1. __Highlighting the motivations.__ The issue of directly using ViT into GAN is that the very high computational cost of the vanilla self-attention used by ViT makes the model fail to generate ultra-high-resolution images. That\u2019s the reason why ViT-based GANs like [1] and [2] can only produce images up to the resolution of $64 \\times 64$. This motivates us to design a more efficient Transformer-based generator, where we use blocked multi-axis attention in low-resolution stages and drop self-attention in high-resolution stages of HiT. We will highlight these motivations in the final version.\n\n2. __Related work.__ Thanks for pointing out the related work. We note that TransGAN [1] has been already discussed in Section 2 of the original paper. Both [2] and [3] are available after the NeurIPS submission so they are not included in the current version. [2] improves [1] by using modulated layers as in StyleGAN2 and more advanced training schema, but they both fail to generate high-resolution images (e.g., $1024 \\times 1024$) due to the high computational cost of ViT-based self-attention. [3] also presents local self-attention within image blocks but it does not perform self-attention across blocks as in HiT. We will discuss them in the final version as suggested.\n\n3. __Highlighting the novelty.__ Thanks for the suggestion. Our novelty lies in the following three aspects: (1) a two-stage attention-based framework combining (2) and (3) which can generate ultra-high-resolution images; (2) blocked multi-axis attention that improves the axial attention; (3) efficient self-modulation with cross-attention. All of them are non-trivial. We will highlight them in the final version.\n\n4. (1) __In Figure 1, what is block $B_i$? Are the two $B_0$ the same in the figure?__ $B_i$ means the i-th image block (non-overlapping patch) as shown in Figure 2 of the original paper. They are different across stages. (2) __In Line 154, why b\u00d7b\u223cH/b\u00d7W/b?__ In order to balance the sequence length between different attention axes, we need to select the value of $b$ so that the block size $b \\times b$ and the number of blocks $\\frac{H}{b} \\times \\frac{W}{b}$ should be as close as possible. (3) __In Lines 157 and 174, could you please give a more detailed analysis of complexity?__ In general, performing dot-product attention between two input sequences of length $N$ and $M$ requires a total of $\\mathcal{O}(NM)$ computation. When computing the balanced multi-axis attention (Line 157) on an image with the block size of $S$, i.e., $S^2 = N = M$, we perform attention on $S$ sequences of length $S$, which is a total of $\\mathcal{O}(S \\cdot S^2) = \\mathcal{O}(N\\sqrt{N})$ computation. In the case of cross-attention (Line 174), since the embedding size $M$ is pre-defined and usually far less than $N$, i.e., $M \\ll N$, so the cross-attention operation has linear complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N)$.\n\n5. (1) __Comparison with BigGANs.__ As reported in the BigBiGAN paper, BigGAN achieves 30.91 FID on unconditional ImageNet $128 \\times 128$. But we note that the BigGAN model is far larger (more than 160M # of params) than HiT (around 50M # of params), so the results are not directly comparable. Even though, HiT (31.78 FID) is only slightly shy of BigGAN and achieves the state of the art among models with a similar capacity as shown in Table 1 of the original paper. (2) __Comparison with Nested Transformer.__ The table below shows the comparison with Nested Transformer on ImageNet $128 \\times 128$. We can see that incorporating cross-attention and multi-axis attention as in HiT yields much better performance than vanilla Nested Transformer. We will add all these results in the final version.\n| Method | FID | IS |\n| ----------------------------- | -------- | -------- |\n| Nested Transformer | 42.52 | 18.68 |\n| HiT | 31.87 | 21.32 |\n",

    "review": "The paper combines two existing techniques of blocked and axial attention in a novel way to create a convolutional free generator. The final proposed architecture shows competitive or better image generation compared to existing state of the art techniques on multiple datasets according to the FID metric.  \n\n**Clarity**: The paper is easy to follow and well written. \n\n**Additional comments and questions**:  \n* The paper proposes cross-attention which is similar to self-modulation technique. It would be good to see an ablation experiment that shows the performance of using self-modulation instead of cross-attention and its added advantage.   \n* Will the proposed architecture also provide benefit in case of conditional image generation?   \n* In Table 5, the paper only shows the result with cross-attention+blocked axial attention, It would be interesting to see the benefit when only blocked axial attention is employed without using cross-attention. \n* In Table 6, does having blocked axial attention for all layers (i.e. configuration [5,0]) leads to high memory requirement as it is not shown? \n* Though the paper proposes convolutional free generator and therefore has MLPs at the higher resolution blocks, but will having convolutional blocks instead of MLPs at later blocks provide any benefit? \nDoes the ConvNetR1 baseline includes self-attention layer at one the generator blocks similar to self-attention GANs? \n\n**Related work missing**: One of the relevant related work \"Self-supervised gans via auxiliary rotation loss.\" is missing and would be great to see a fair performance comparison with this as the baseline. This above work shows 23.6 FID metric on unconditional image generation on ImageNet 128x128 dataset which is better than the score reported by the proposed technique.\n\n####################\nUpdate: \n\nThanks for addressing all the comments in the rebuttal. I am adjusting my score based on the answers. \n\nAdditional comments: Are the results on ImageNet dataset with HiT-S architecture? If possible, it would be interesting to compare HiT-L (with similar #params as BigGANs) with BigGAN for ImageNet dataset in the final draft of paper.  \nAfter reading other reviewer\u2019s comment, I agree about including attention visualization in the paper. \n\n",
    "comment": "We thank the reviewer\u2019s detailed comments and recognition of our novelty and state-of-the-art performance. Below are our responses to the points raised by the reviewer. We hope these will help improve the clarity of the paper.\n\n1. __Comparison with self-modulation.__ Thanks for the suggestion. The table below shows the comparison between HiT models using cross-attention and self-modulation on ImageNet $128 \\times 128$, respectively. We can see that the proposed cross-attention achieves better performance since the attention mechanism is more powerful than the normalization form used in self-modulation. We will add the result in the final version.\n| Method | FID | IS |\n| ----------------------------- | -------- | -------- |\n| HiT w/ self-modulation | 33.15 | 20.86 |\n| HiT w/ cross-attention | 31.87 | 21.32 |\n\n2. __Will the proposed architecture also provide benefit in case of conditional image generation?__ Yes, we believe so since we do not make any specific assumption about the model input during the architecture design of HiT, and thus it should also be able to benefit conditional image generation. But adding conditions to HiT is non-trivial and we will explore it in our future work.\n\n3. __Comparison with the model using only blocked axial attention.__ Thanks for the suggestion. The table below shows the model performance when only blocked multi-axis attention is used on ImageNet $128 \\times 128$. We can observe that using only blocked multi-axis attention can still lead to significant performance improvement which demonstrates its effectiveness. We will include these results in the final version.\n| Method | FID | IS |\n| ----------------------------- | -------- | -------- |\n| Baseline (INR) | 56.33 | 16.19 |\n| HiT w/ only blocked multi-axis attention | 35.43 | 19.75 |\n| HiT w/ only cross-attention | 35.94 | 19.42 |\n| HiT (Full model) | 31.87 | 21.32 |\n\n4. __Does having blocked axial attention for all layers (i.e. configuration [5,0]) lead to high memory requirement as it is not shown?__ Yes, we do not show this configuration since it requires high memory cost but no additional improvement can be achieved over the configuration [4, 1].\n\n5. (1) __Will having convolutional blocks instead of MLPs at later blocks provide any benefit?__ In our initial experiments, we do not observe notable performance improvement if we use convolutional blocks instead of MLPs in high-resolution stages, while convolutional operations lead to much higher memory and computational cost. Thus we chose MLPs after balancing the tradeoff between performance and cost. (2) __Does the ConvNetR1 baseline include self-attention layers similar to self-attention GANs?__ Yes, it follows the same design of self-attention GANs. We will clarity these in the final version.\n\n6. __Comparison with \"Self-supervised gans via auxiliary rotation loss\" (SS-GAN).__ Thanks for pointing out the missing related work. We note that the SS-GAN model achieving 23.6 FID uses the BigGAN\u2019s architecture which is far larger (more than 160M # of params) than HiT (around 50M # of params). But when compared to the SS-GAN model having a similar model capacity (Table 1 of the SS-GAN paper) with HiT, HiT (31.87 FID) still outperforms SS-GAN (43.87 FID) by a large margin.

    "comment": "Thank you for your detailed feedback. We appreciate that you went through our work in detail, including the proofs in the supplementary material. We are very thankful for your positive feedback and suggestions to improve experiments, writing and clarity of proofs. \n\n### Q. ... cannot fully follow the logic in the proof of lemma 1\n\nWe clarify the confusion in three steps: i) clarify eq.(17) ii) how eq.(18) is obtained from (17), iii) explain eq.(19).\n\ni) Clarification of eq.(17):\nWithin a disk, $D_j$, we have , $||f-f_j|| \\leq \\eta$\nthen from (16), we have $|\\ell_z(f)- \\ell_z(f_j)|\\leq 2\\sqrt{S_K}||f-f_j||_{\\mathcal{H}_K} \\leq 2\\sqrt{S_K}\\eta$. Now, we choose $\\eta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2\\sqrt{S_K}}$.  Plugging in $\\epsilon = 2\\sqrt{S_K}\\eta$ in the previous equation, we obtain, $|\\ell_z(f)- \\ell_z(f_j)|\\leq \\epsilon$.\nThis is true for any $f$ within the disk $D_j$.\n\nNow, we show $\\ell_z(f_j) \\geq |\\ell_z(f)| - \\epsilon$. To show this, $|\\ell_z(f)| = |\\ell_z(f) - \\ell_z(f_j) + \\ell_z(f_j)| \\leq |\\ell_z(f) - \\ell_z(f_j)| + |\\ell_z(f_j)|$ using triangle inequality. Therefore, $|\\ell_z(f)| \\leq \\epsilon + |\\ell_z(f_j)|$, from which we obtain $\\ell_z(f_j) \\geq |\\ell_z(f)| - \\epsilon$. From this statement, it is easy to see that, for any $f \\in D_j$, if $|\\ell_z(f)| \\geq 2\\epsilon$, then it must be true that $|\\ell_z(f_j)| \\geq \\epsilon$, which is precisely eq.(17).\n\nii)Obtaining eq.(18) from eq.(17):\nLet us denote the left hand side and right hand side of eq.(17) as events A and B; i.e.,\n$\\underset{f\\in D_j}{sup}{| \\ell_z(f)| \\geq 2\\epsilon}$ is denoted by $A$ and $|\\ell_z(f_j)| \\geq \\epsilon$ as B.\nThen eq.(17) says $A$ implies $B$. That means whenever A happens, B also happens, but not vice versa. Therefore, represented as a set, set A is possibly smaller than B, and furthermore, A is a subset of B. When A is a subset of B, we have $Pr(A) \\leq Pr(B)$ by using the Monotonicity property of probability measure. \nUsing Hoeffding's inequality, we can further obtain, $Pr(B) = Pr(|\\ell_z(f_j)| \\geq \\epsilon) \\leq e^{\\frac{-m\\epsilon^2}{2M^2}}$. Since $Pr(A) \\leq Pr(B)$, we obtain, $Pr(A) \\leq e^{\\frac{-m\\epsilon^2}{2M^2}}$\nwhich is exactly eq.(18).\n\niii) Explanation of last line after eq.(19):\nEq.(19) is of the form $Pr(X\\geq 2\\epsilon) \\leq a$. We take the probability of its complement. From eq.(19), therefore, we can obtain $Pr(X \\leq 2\\epsilon) \\geq 1-a$, which would be $\nPr(\\underset{f\\in \\mathcal{H}}{sup}{| \\ell_z(f)| \\leq 2\\epsilon} )\\geq 1- 2\\mathcal{N}(\\mathcal{H},\\frac{\\epsilon}{2\\sqrt{S_K}})e^{-\\frac{m\\epsilon^2}{2M^2}}\n$\nThen, we finally set $\\epsilon = \\epsilon/2$ to obtain the last line after eq.(19)\n\n### Q. Is $\\eta$ set to $\\frac{\\epsilon}{2\\sqrt{S_K}}$ or $\\frac{\\epsilon}{4\\sqrt{S_K}}$ ?\n\nIn proving eq.(17), we choose $\\eta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2\\sqrt{S_K}}$. But, later in proving the last line after eq.(19), we again set $\\epsilon = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$ as we explained in the previous question. So, the combined effect is that we choose $\\eta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{4\\sqrt{S_K}}$ as stated in the main text.\n\n### Q. How is the norm of $g$ related to $R$?\n\nThe RKHS norm $||f||\\_{\\mathcal{H}\\_K}$ is related to the norm of $g$, $||g||\\_{\\mathcal{L}\\_2(d\\tau)}$ by the following relation: $||f||^2\\_{\\mathcal{H}\\_K} \\leq ||g||^2_{\\mathcal{L}\\_2(d\\tau)}$, where $d\\tau$ is the probability measure on the domain $\\mathcal{W}$ of $g$ as defined in Theorem 1. This is one of the important result due to Bach et al.[15]. $R$ is nothing but the radius of the RKHS ball under consideration, so $R = ||f||\\_{H\\_K}$. Hence, we use $||g||\\_{\\mathcal{L}\\_2(d\\tau)}$ as an upper bound on $R$ and minimize the upper bound during optimization. This relation between norm of $g$ and RKHS norm of $f$ is stated in Theorem 1, but it seems to be easily missed. So, we will explicitly explain this relation in the main text in our final version to enhance clarity.\n\n### Q. KL curve before unstable epochs\n\nWe used high range in the y-axis for the neural net discriminator (left figure) to highlight the fact that after around 600 epochs, the discriminator does get unstable. In the region before 600 epochs, the KL divergence with the neural net discriminator is to some extent stable although not as smooth as with the regularized RKHS discriminator. It still jitters a little bit. \n\nSome sample images during this time is shown in Fig 3(a): top row shows that decoding is not that terrible even for the unregularized neural network discriminator. To make this comparison more precise and quantitative, following your suggestion, we have computed FID score (smaller the better) between reconstruction and ground truth after each epoch.  Below are the FID scores.\n\n Epoch  $ \\hspace{0.7cm} 100   \\hspace{0.5cm} 200  \\hspace{0.5cm}   300  \\hspace{0.5cm}  400  \\hspace{0.5cm}   500   \\hspace{0.5cm}  600   \\hspace{0.5cm}  700   \\hspace{0.5cm}  800 \\hspace{0.5cm}    900 $\n \n NNet  Disc. $49.64  \\hspace{0.2cm}43.25 \\hspace{0.2cm} 47.52  \\hspace{0.2cm}44.29  \\hspace{0.2cm}51.31 \\hspace{0.2cm} 52.45  \\hspace{0.2cm}148.9  \\hspace{0.2cm}157.5  \\hspace{0.2cm}261.9 $\n \n RKHS Disc.  $37.58  \\hspace{0.2cm}33.18 \\hspace{0.2cm} 31.46 \\hspace{0.2cm} 31.39  \\hspace{0.2cm}30.36 \\hspace{0.2cm} 29.37 \\hspace{0.2cm} 28.17\\hspace{0.2cm} 28.18 \\hspace{0.2cm} 28.17$\n \nA couple of observations are in order. Even for the neural net architecture the FID score is below 50 upto 400 epochs and it is fluctuating. Thus, before the discriminator blows up, the reconstruction is okay. However, this score is worse than the RKHS discriminator which has scores in the range of 30-40 upto epoch 400. For the neural network discriminator, the score increases (worsens) in the range of 50 for epochs 500 and 600. Once the epoch reaches 700, the discriminator becomes completely unstable and FID score shoots up reaching 262 at epoch 900. \n\nOn the other hand, for the RKHS discriminator, the score steadily and smoothly decreases as the epoch increases reaching the best 28.17 at epoch 900.\n\nThis experiment demonstrates that the proposed RKHS discriminator with norm regularization is both reliable and effective in terms of standard metric like FID.\n\n### Q.  Bias doesn't go away\n\nIt is true that there seems to be a small bias in the experiment (Fig. 1(a,b)) even though our estimates are significantly better than using Neural network discriminator without regularization. \nWe believe this might have to do with inherent estimation bias when we are dealing with finite amount of data. Even though we have shown that the estimate is consistent when the data goes to infinity; when data is finite, some bias may be inevitable.\n\n### Q. $\\psi$ and $\\tau$ are not defined appropriately\n\nThank you for your feedback. We will take this advice and appropriately define all the variables after Theorem 1.",

They are honest about the limitations of their method (discussion of assumptions and paragraph at end) and do not overstate their results, which is refreshing. They provide sketches of proofs in the main text to provide intuition / high level understanding of the results. \n\nI can't comment on the novelty of the idea; I am unaware of work that tries to use RKHS norms to control neural network function complexity in this way, but I am not an expert in this field and am not up to date with the latest literature. If this is a novel idea then I find it quite exciting and is worthy of merit in its own right (regardless of the rest of the paper). If it is not novel, appropriate citations should be added.\n\nI'm generally happy with it but have a few points I'd like to be addressed. I've given \"weak accept\" but would be willing to raise this rating if the authors can address them: \n\n- the results are all cast in terms of the L2(\\tau) norm of g. How does this relate to the RKHS norm of f? At the beginning of the paper, I thought you would control the RKHS norm of f -- I think this is implicitly being done, but would be great if you could make this more explicit / comment on this.\n- variance analysis: I understand that theorem 3 only applies under the strong assumption of the deviation-from-mean being Gaussian. Is it not possible to make some statements about how the variance decays under some other weaker assumptions? If not, are there (perhaps pathological) cases where the variance does not decay?\n- at the beginning you claim that the existing methods suffer due to having uncontrolled function complexity. Do you have any evidence to support this claim? Do these other methods not use regularisation in practice?\n\n\nNon-technical issues:\n- Figures: I think you're converting your figures to PNG or JPG before embedding them into the document. Much better is to save them as PDFs -- that way they are not blurry when you zoom in on a computer.\n- I think you are maybe just writing KL in math mode, but if you use use add this latex command: \\newcommand{\\KL}{\\mathrm{KL}} and then use \\KL it may look better depending on your taste (feel free to ignore this if you don't like it though).\n\n\n \nOther detailed comments:\n- line 54: gap before (RKHS)\n- line 138: \"w ~ N(O, \\gamma I)\" -> is this saying that \\tau is the normal distribution? Could you state that explicitly if so?\n- line 140: could you maybe make it explicit here that \\phi (and I guess also g?) will be implemented as neural networks?\n- line 144: \"both the RKHS kernel and its norm\" -> \"both the RKHS kernel and the norm of f\"\n- You don't really discuss the RKHS norm of f directly. Could you at least briefly mention it here, in particular how it relates to \\phi and g? \n- line 151: both \\tau and h have already been used, but I don't think the occurrences in this line are referring to either of them?\n- line 166: what does M-bounded mean?\n- line 194: approximately what kind of order of magnitude do you expect the positive part inside the exp to be?

    "comment": "We would like to thank you for your detailed feedback on our work, technical, non technical and related to writing and presentation. We are also thankful for the encouraging comments on the novelty and merit of our work. We feel encouraged and excited. \n\n### Q. Novelty of the idea\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no previous work that tries to model a neural network function explicitly such that it lies on an RKHS space. Also, we have not seen any work that try to look at discriminators from the perspective of complexity of their function space and its role in stability. Therefore, we are also excited that this could open multiple interesting research directions for researchers in the field. We are very thankful for your encouragement.\n\n### Q. Relation between L2 norm of $g$ and RKHS norm of $f$\n\nThe RKHS norm $||f||\\_{\\mathcal{H}\\_K}$ is related to the norm of $g$ , $||g||\\_{\\mathcal{L}\\_2(d\\tau)}$ by the following relation: $||f||^2\\_{\\mathcal{H}\\_K} \\leq ||g||^2\\_{\\mathcal{L}\\_2(d\\tau)}$, where $d\\tau$ is the probability measure on the domain $\\mathcal{W}$ of $g$ as defined in Theorem 1. This is one of the important results due to Bach et al.[15].  Hence, we use $||g||\\_{\\mathcal{L}\\_2(d\\tau)}$ as an upper bound on $||f||\\_{\\mathcal{H}\\_K}$ and minimize the upper bound during optimization. This relation between norm of $g$ and RKHS norm of $f$ is stated in Theorem 1, but it seems to be easily missed. So, we will explicitly explain this relation in the main text in our final version to improve clarity.\n\n### Q. Variance analysis: ...is it not possible to make statements about how the variance decays under some other weaker assumptions?\n\nThis is an important question for discussion. So far, we know that we can do similar analysis if the estimate is distributed as an exponential distribution. The key idea is how the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is related to the variance. To clarify this point further, let's look at the eq.(33) in the proof of Theorem 3 in supplementary material:\n$1 - \\Phi_{\\mu, \\sigma}(\\mu + \\epsilon) \\leq 2\\exp\\Bigg[\\left( \\frac{4RC_s\\sqrt{S_K||\\mathscr{L}_s||}}{\\epsilon} \\right)^{\\frac{2n}{h}}-\\frac{m\\epsilon^2}{4M^2}\\Bigg]$\n\nThis equation connects the CDF to the variables like $S_K$, $R$, $\\mathscr{L}\\_s$ of the discriminator function space and does not yet assumes anything about the shape of the distribution. For a Gaussian distribution, we plug in CDF of a Gaussian distribution, $\\Phi_{\\mu, \\sigma}(\\hat{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big[1 + \\text{erf} \\big(\\frac{\\hat{x}-\\mu}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2}}\\big)\\Big]$. For any other distribution, we can simply plug in the expression for the CDF, and carry out analysis similar to the proof of Theorem 3. However, a key factor that determines the behavior between the variance and the discriminator complexity is how variance appears in the CDF expression. \nFor example, in both Gaussian distribution and in exponential distribution, we know that the relation between CDF function and variance is inversely related - note that the standard deviation, $\\sigma$ appears in the denominator of Gaussian CDF. \nWe believe that as long as this inverse type of relation between CDF and variance holds, we can obtain statements like Theorem 3 for other distributions as well. Consequently, in such distributions, the behavior that the variance decays as we penalize the complexity should hold. However, the behavior of the CDF function and its relation to variance depends on the exact shape of the probability density function (PDF) or CDF function of the estimate. Without the knowledge of the shape of the CDF or PDF, it is not possible to make statements about the decay of the variance. By changing the relation between CDF and variance, one may even be able to construct a pathological case where the variance doesn't decrease, but that would be too artificial.\n\n### Q. Uncontrolled complexity in other methods\n\nIn the original papers like AVB and VDM, they neither consider the  discriminator from the function space perspective nor try to control its complexity. However, to help in several practical aspects of training they apply other techniques. For example, gradient clipping has been suggested in VDM. Similarly, in AVB, they modify the KL divergence loss by using an adaptive Gaussian distribution, a method termed as 'adaptive contrast'. Additionally, they also apply other design choices in the discriminator, like adding a direct skip connection in the discriminator. While these methods may help in training, it is not clear if they actually control the complexity of the discriminator. When it comes to explicit complexity regularization, we are not aware of any method that explicitly regularize the complexity of the discriminator. There is also another problem in trying to control the complexity of a neural network discriminator: it is difficult to come up with an appropriate/meaningful notion of complexity. One of the reasons we constructed $f$ in RKHS is that it enables us to use well-defined complexity measure of the RKHS function space.\n\n### Q. Nontechnical issues\n\nThe images were directly plotted using matplotlib in python. We will save images in pdf format as you suggested to increase image quality. Also, we will increase the quality of those plots by setting dpi high while saving.\n\nUsing '\\mathrm{ KL } ' instead of 'KL' in the math mode seems like a good idea. We will follow your suggestion.\n\n### Q. Other detailed comments\n\nline 138: Yes $\\tau$ is a Gaussian distribution and we will explicitly mention it in our final version.\n\nline140: We will make it explicit that $\\phi$ and $g$ are neural networks.\n\nline We will explicitly mention the relation between RKHS norm and $g$ in the paragraph after Theorem 1.\n\nline 166: M-bounded means the infinity norm of the function $f$ is upper bounded by a number $M$\n\nline 194: Unfortunately it is difficult to estimate numerical value of this quantity as it involves some constants like $C_p$ which are not really known and it is very difficult to compute norms like $||\\mathscr{L}_p||$.\n\nequation 14: Yes, $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the estimate. We will correct this in our final version.\n\nWe will make appropriate changes in line 54, 144, 151 and 264 as you have suggested in the final version of our paper.",

    "comment": "We would like to thank you for being generous with your time, going through the details of our work and providing us insightful feedback. We are also encouraged to know that you see the potential of our work to have a broader and more general impact beyond KL divergence estimation, for example, in GANs.\n\n### Q. $C_p, S_p, {L}_p$. How are they related to $\\phi$ and $\\gamma$\n$C_p$ is a constant not depending on $S_p$, $L_p$ or $R$,  and it is always finite. See https://home.ttic.edu/~smale/papers/math_foundation_of_learning.pdf page 20, example 4 and proof of Theorem D in pages 50-51 for more details. They use results from [Edmunds and Triebel 1996], who prove that there exists some constant $C$, to obtain entropy number in Sobolev spaces.\n\n $S_p$ and $L_p$ are related to $\\phi$, $\\gamma$ through the kernel $K_{\\theta_p}$. Note that $K_{\\theta_p}$ is the optimal kernel corresponding to the optimal neural network parameter $\\theta_p$. $S_p$ is defined as \n$S_p=\\underset{x,t}{sup} \\hspace{0.1cm} {K(x,t)} = \\underset{x,t}{sup} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\gamma \\phi_{\\theta_p}^T(x)\\phi_{\\theta_p}(t)$.\nTherefore, it is directly related to the network $\\phi_{\\theta_p}$. We show that this is finite due to Lipschitz constraint on $\\phi_{\\theta_p}$ as described in Assumption A2. The proof is provided in the Supplementary material page 2. \n\n$||\\mathscr{L}\\_p||$ is upper bounded as follows:\n$||\\mathscr{L}\\_p|| \\leq \\rho(\\mathcal{X})\\sum\\_{|\\alpha|\\leq h/2}\\underset{x,t \\in \\mathcal{X}}{sup}(D^{\\alpha}_x K\\_{\\theta_p}(x,t))^2$\n\n$= \\rho(\\mathcal{X})\\sum\\_{|\\alpha|\\leq h/2}\\underset{x,t \\in \\mathcal{X}}{sup}(D^{\\alpha}\\_x \\gamma \\phi\\_{\\theta_p}^T(x)\\phi\\_{\\theta_p}(t))^2$, \nwhere $D^{\\alpha}\\_x$ is an $\\alpha$ order differentiation operator. \nTherefore, the finiteness of $||\\mathscr{L}\\_p||$ depends on the finiteness of the higher order derivatives of $\\phi_{\\theta_p}$. $||\\mathscr{L}\\_p||$ is finite if the higher order derivatives exist and are finite. It means if the function $\\phi_{\\theta_p}$ is differentiable, and gradients are not infinite, then $||\\mathscr{L}\\_p||$ is also finite and well-behaved. For example, when the activation function inside the neural network is differentiable, the derivative of $\\phi_{\\theta_p}$ is finite and $||\\mathscr{L}\\_p||$ is also finite. In the case of ReLU activation function, however, this is more subtle because, strictly speaking, ReLU is not differentiable at the origin. There may, however, be a way to use subgradients or define gradients in a different way consistent with the backpropagation (after all, backpropagation through ReLU is commonly available, so in some sense the gradient of ReLU is still well-defined). We have noted this difficulty in the limitation section of our paper and left the more rigorous work in this direction for the future.\n\n### Q. Is sup $K_{\\theta}$ over $\\phi$ and $\\gamma$ both?\n$\\underset{K_{\\theta}}{sup}$ is only with respect to architectures $\\phi_{\\theta}$. We treat $\\gamma$ as a hyperparameter and is treated as a constant in the optimization. \n\n### Q. Results showing VDM and MINE are unstable\nWe have carried out these experiments and reproduced the results as per your suggestion.\n\nExperiment details:\nThe experimental setup and discriminator architecture are the same as with other experiments in main paper (like Fig. 1). We randomly sample (2500) points from each of the two distributions and run experiments on these fixed samples to simulate a scenario, where data do not come infinitely from the source. With the same simple architecture and setup as our other experiments, we ran VDM and MINE. \n\nFor the case where the ground truth value is 13.8, VDM gives unreasonably high estimates as follows (on 10 independent runs):\n\n$836.43, \\hspace{0.3cm} 459.26,\\hspace{0.3cm} 589.36, \\hspace{0.3cm}1158.93, \\hspace{0.3cm}386.1, \\hspace{0.3cm}3232.4, \\hspace{0.3cm}1067.3, \\hspace{0.3cm}263.2, \\hspace{0.3cm}1010.7$\n\nFor ground truth value of 38, the estimates go high in the order of $10,000$. \n\nSimilarly, we ran experiments for MINE. In this experiment, the value of KL divergence steadily increases and after some time, it starts to give a 'Not a number' token, which we consider as being unstable.\n\nIn the beginning of our project, we did these experiments and realized that in this setting, these methods are unstable. We also verified that other works in the literature have reported such cases of unreliable estimates [8,9]. Therefore, we decided to shift our focus only on AVB type of objective, which was slightly better behaved than VDM and MINE at the moment. We tried to understand how the discriminator complexity plays a role in AVB type objective, and, to that end, developed a theory that could shed light on the stability/reliability behavior of those objectives (eq. 3,4 in the main paper). Since the objective functions of VDM/MINE are different from the objective we analyzed, our theoretical analysis is not directly relevant to VDM/MINE. Second, the results were unstable. Therefore, we did not include the numerical results of VDM/MINE in our main paper and simply commented that they were unstable. We also did not carry out extensive experiments after our initial experiments in VDM/MINE. However, we believe that not controlling the complexity of the discriminator could be a common cause of instability in discriminator based methods and could be directly related to the unstable behavior of VDM/MINE approaches too.\n\n### Q. Consistency of the regularized estimator?\nTheorem 4 actually talks about the consistency of the regularized estimator. In the statement of Theorem 4, eq.(13) is used as the optimal function, $f^m_h$, which optimizes the regularized objective. And then we show that $|KL_m(f^m_h)-KL(f^*)| \\to 0$, i.e. the KL estimate obtained from the regularized objective approaches the true KL estimate. Theorem 4 in the supplementary material has more details and proof of consistency.\n\n### Q. Spectral normalization is not used in the baseline\nSpectral normalization is one of the important assumptions based on which we develop our theory. Specifically, using spectral normalization, we show that the quantities like $S_p$ and $||g||^2$ are finite (see Supplementary materials page 2). Intuitively, we believe spectral normalization helps to ensure the smoothness of the discriminator and perhaps helps in controlling complexity and in stabilization. On the other hand, the baseline methods do not take into account the complexity of the discriminator or consider its smoothness. Therefore, we simply followed the proposed algorithms of baseline methods and did not use spectral normalization with them.\n\n\n### Reference\n Edmunds, D. and Triebel, H.

    "submission_title": "Bridging Explicit and Implicit Deep Generative Models via Neural Stein Estimators",
    "review": "**Pros:** The idea of using a combination of implicit and explicit models for joint training has been explored before in several papers recently (as the authors discuss in the detailed literature review section)  and is an interesting direction of research. Furthermore, the proposal to use mutual regularization of the two models to train such models is intriguing and novel. Additionally, the experiments presented in the paper provide promising results and improvements.\n\n**Cons:** \n- My major concern (which spans the previous works on jointly training implicit and explicit models as well) is the motivation behind the joint training of implicit and explicit model itself. It seems that this strategy introduces an expensive overhead of training two rather costly models to overcome the the drawbacks of the individual models. Furthermore, the solution itself does not directly address the drawbacks present in the individual models itself but indirectly makes things better for the models. While I liked the idea of incorporating the loss term between the implicit and the explicit model (D_3 in Table 1), I am still not clear what additional information this term provides during training apart from the data and the other two terms. \n\n- Secondly, the authors mentioned in the paper that any metric can be easily used for training the models (apart from Wasserstein or Jenson-Shanon etc). However, if I am not mistaken, the theoretical analysis presented by the authors in Section 4 is based on the Wasserstein metric. I wonder if these results will hold for other metrics as well? What impact do the authors foresee of different metrics on their analysis?\n\n- (*minor*): The authors train an implicit and explicit model together. Which of these models is finally used after training? Is it the case that the implicit model is used for sample generation and the explicit model for inference based tasks? \n\n-  The methodology presented here comes across as rather too costly for training an energy based model specially given the fairly light-weight methods present for training EBMs. I believe the paper will benefit from having a comparison between the training using the proposed methodology and these already present methods for training EBMs.\n\n- Finally, while the experiments comprehensively show that the proposed model achieves good results, I would have liked to see experiments on more complicated datasets than MNIST and CIFAR 10. This stems from my worry of the costly procedure of training two models jointly and how well this will scale to higher-dimensions and more complicated datasets. ",
    "comment": "Thank you for the positive comments and constructive feedback.\nBelow we address the your concerns.\n\n**Q1**. Motivation and additional information the extra term provides during training.\n\nThank you for this great question! We kindly remind that the motivation for combining the training of two classes of generative models not only lies in overcoming their respective limitations but also enables sample generation and density estimation in a unified framework. As discussed in line 30-37 of our paper, there are situations where one may need both samples and (unnormalized) densities at one time or the availability of both of them would be really helpful for some specific tasks. This serves as another motivation for combining both of the worlds in a new formulation.\n\nIndeed, there is no additional information brought by the third term since we do not use extra side information other than the observed samples as input. Yet, as shown in our theoretical analysis, the Stein bridging term acts as mutual regularization for two models which can help them to better identify the data distribution and generate more high-quality samples, compared with training a single model which has respective limitations (as discussed in Section 1 intuitively and Section 3 theoretically). Also, we show that the joint training approach can help to stabilize the training dynamics, which is another merit brought by the extra term. \n\n**Q2**. If the theoretical results hold for other metrics?\n\nA good question.\nTheorem 1 describes the impact of the Stein bridging on the critic. As a result, it can hold similarly if we replace the Wasserstein metric in Eqn. 3 with other metrics, as long as this metric admits a variational form that involves a critic (e.g., $f$-divergences). In this case, Eqn. 10 in Appendix will be changed into a slightly  different form, but the subsequent argument of the regularization effect of the Stein discrepancy on the critic should follow in a similar fashion.\n\nTheorem 2 relies on crucially the choice of metrics, and in particular, the Moreau-Yosida regularization comes from the proprieties of the Wasserstein metric. If we replace the Wasserstein metric in Eqn. 3 with other $f$-divergences, it may result in a different regularization behavior such as variance regularization.\n\n**Q3**. Which of these models is finally used after training?\n\nWe use the explicit model for inference (density estimation) and the implicit model for sample generation. Your understanding is exactly right! This is indeed another merit for joint training two models, i.e., we can flexibly obtain estimated density and generated samples from two models simultaneously.\n\n**Q4**. Comparison with other methods for training EBM.\n\nThis is a good point. Actually, our baseline DGM and DEM are two methods for training the EBM by contrastive divergence and using Stein discrepancy (i.e., what we use in our model), respectively. The difficulty for training EBM lies in how to handle the normalizing constant which is intractable in general cases. The Stein's method used in our framework is an effective way to detour the normalizing constant by considering the gradient of log-density, which avoids the heavy cost for estimating the denominator.\n\n**Q5**. Scalability of proposed method\n\nActually, as illustrated in line 798, our model is two times slower than WGAN on average throughout the experiments. Our model can scale smoothly to larger datasets beyond MNIST/CIFAR-10 that we used. As a further validation, we also use LSUN dataset (a large-scale image dataset that is much more challenging than CIFAR-10) for our out-of-distribution detection task for testing the explicit model. Concretely, we treat CIFAR-10 as positive examples and LSUN images as negative examples. The model aims to distinguish the images from two datasets and is expected to give high density values for CIFAR-10 images and low density values for LSUN images. We compare our model with DEM, DGM and EGAN and obtain the results of Area Under of Curve (AUC): DEM 0.56, DGM 0.82, EGAN 0.56 and Joint-W 0.85. The results indicate that our model Joint-W can more accurately identify out-of-distribution samples from in-distribution ones, showing better empirical performance for density estimation in the high-dimensional inference tasks. We believe that these results can further strengthen our contribution.",

Below we provide a short-version summary for the motivation of our framework:\n\n- The extra Stein terms allows two classes of generative models to be jointly trained in a cooperative manner (Intuitively, the explicit one plays as a sample evaluator and the implicit one can augment the observed samples).\n- The unfied framework enables (unnormalized) density estimation and sample generation at one time, which is beneficial for various tasks that require both of them.\n- We theoretically justify the approach by showing that the joint learning enables mutual compensation between two models via regularization effects.\n\nThank you very much for the time reading our comments.\n",

    "review": "### Originality\nThe main idea of briding is simple and straightforward. However, the theoretical analysis is the main contribution of the paper and seems to be non-trivial. It provides some insights into the regularization effect of the Stein bridging. The author also addresses the differences between this work and the previous ones in the appendix. So in summary, I think this work is interesting and novel. \n\n### Quality and Clarity\nThe main idea is easy to follow and clearly written. Some of the simple toy examples (from Theorem 1 and Theorem 2) help to visualize the effect of the regularization. However, I have several concerns regarding the Stein discrepancy and proof. I think there is still a large room for improvements of the quality. I will elaborate on them in the question section. \n\n### Significance\nThis proposed framework seems to have many desirable advantages in terms of implicit model training stability and explicit model training quality. In terms of theory, the author shed some light on the effect of joint learning of these two types of models. So it should have some impacts in this community. \n\n### Questions\n1. The first question regards the usage of Stein discrepancy. Using Stein discrepancy to train models can be quite problematic. For example, the Stein discrepancy can be highly non-convex and does not agrees with commonly used divergence (e.g. KL divergence). In other words, when use Stein discrepancy as the training objective (in you case, the learning of explicit model and Stein bridging), a lower discrepancy value does not necessarily mean a good model (the two densities $P_E$ and $P_G$ can be arbitrarily far away in KL divergence sense) unless the global optimum is achieved [1]. This is particularly problematic for gradient-based optimization. So does this pathology of Stein discrepancy affect the Stein bridging? Or the Stein bridging only act as regularization and has no direct impact to model learning. \n2. One quick check for question 1 could be replacing the components in Two-Circle example by Student-t distributions. The EBM is initialized as a mixture of Student-t distribution with the same scale and degree-of-freedom but different means (need to be far-away from the ground truth).  I wonder about the behaviours of the explicit and implicit models, and its training dynamics. \n3. For the definition of Stein discrepancy, when $d'\\neq d$, is the corresponding Stein discrepancy a valid one? Does the max-pooing matrix norm guarantee a valid discrepancy?\n4. I am a bit confused on why Sobolev dual norm penalizes the large variation of critic. Maybe consider adding some explanation on the intuition behind this norm?\n5. Maybe consider adding some intuitive explanations on Moreau-Yoshida regularization?\n6. What is $p_r$ in line 615, is it $P_{real}$?\n7. For KSD, the form mentioned below line 619 is different from the one you introduced in the main text. I understand this comes from integration by parts, but maybe explicitly mention this before line 619? Also, should it be $\\nabla_{\\pmb{x}}\\log d\\mathbb{P}_E/d\\mathbb{P}$?\n8. In line 629, why it is linear w.r.t. $h$? $h$ appears inside the $\\log$.\n9. I am confused about the derivation below the line 634. Why you can introduce the auxiliary variable $r$ and treat it as a decoupled parameter? $r$ should also depend on $h$ as well. \n10. For line 653, why $P$ is unconstrained? I thought that $P$ should be absolutely continuous to $P_E$, but $\\gamma$ only cares about the agreement of the marginal $P$ and $P_{real}$. So it is possible that $P$ is not absolutely continuous to $P_E$. \n11. Why it is equivalent to the set of point masses in line 660? \n\n\n### Reference\n[1] Barp, Alessandro, et al. \"Minimum stein discrepancy estimators.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.08283 (2019)\n\n---\n### Upates after rebuttal\nI appreciated the response. After some discussions with the author, they managed to address my concerns. Therefore, I will raise my score accordingly. However, I still hope more intuitions and explanations about the kernel Sobolev and Moreau-Yoshida regularization can be added in the revised version.  \n",

    "comment": "Thank you for summarizing our contribution precisely and highlights the technical aspects of the paper!\n\nWe also thank the reviewer for comparing our work with [1-2] and shedding more lights on the merits of our approach, which we found insightful and will incorporate this discussion in our main text. \n\nAs for the experiments on MNIST/CIFAR-10, indeed the improvement on sample generation is not much significant since we use standard architectures for two generative models (a shallow neural network). Further performance gain is expected when we use more complex instantiation of two models. For example, as further experiment, we change the specification of energy model to PixelCNN++ which is easy to control pixel-level features of generated images in order to add induction bias. In CIFAR-10, we manage to achieve inception score 7.25. Also, our results in Table 3 show that our model yields much better performance for out-of-distribution detection, which demonstrate superior density estimation than other explicit models in the high-dimensional inference tasks. A more distinctive advantage of our model other than the performance gains is that it enables sample generation and density estimation at one time in a unified framework. We believe that these improvements/advantages serve as more convincing merits of our model within reasonable training time.",

    "review": "The paper is really clear. \nI really liked the idea of exploiting this local superlinear convergence of the QN methods successively, by having $S_1 \\subset S_2 \\subset ...$. The paper explains carefully its concepts, its algorithm implementation compares its cost against AdaNewton and then provides an easy to follow convergence analysis.\n\nMy first main concern (that I will develop below) is that the condition on $m_0$ that is $m_0 = \\Omega (\\kappa^2 s\\log d)$ is to my opinion completely undermined by the authors. \nMy second main concern is the experimental part wish I find unclear and unfair. I develop this below.\n\n\nHere are some comments, critics and questions:\n\nStyle/typo comments:\n- 1) lines 37 and 74/75: not consistent writing of Quasi-Newton / quasi-Newton\n- 2) line 48, not nice looking line because of \\emph\n- 3) line 77: missing word before reference [20]\n- 4) line 106: ERM already defined earlier\n- 5) line 111: $w^*$ is an optimal solution of the expected risk minimization.

To be corrected I think\n- 8) line 7 of Algo. 1: a break-line for $y$ would make it way easier to read\n- 9) $\\mu$ is not really standard for a regularization parameter, I would prefer $\\lambda$ then say $\\mu \\approx \\lambda$\n- 9 bis) line 373: cite maybe the most recent version of Bottou and Bousquet 2011\n\nMajor comments:\n- 10) A long comparison is made against AdaNewton, yet very few comparison is made agaisnt other (stochastic) QN methods like L-BFGS, which is known to perform very well in a lost of case, or the more recent K-BFGS (\"Practical quasi-newton methods for training deep neural networks\", Goldfarb, Ren, Bahamou, 2020) or Stochastic Block BFGS (Stochastic Block BFGS: Squeezing More Curvature out of Data, Gower, Goldfarb, Richtarik, 2016) \n- 11) My main concern (that I will develop below) is that the condition on $m_0$ that is $m_0 = \\Omega (\\kappa^2 s\\log d)$ is to my opinion completely undermined by the authors.  I would have liked a clear explanation about what happens when we are facing a very ill-conditioned problem such that $\\kappa = N$ or even worse  $\\kappa >> N$. What does AdaQN become in such a case ? Does it become QN with a constant sample size $m\\equiv N$ ? In this case isn't it way more costly than 1st order methods ? What about numerical experiments in this case ?\n- 12) In Prop. 1 and elsewhere in the paper, you clearly explain that having $S_1 \\subset S_2 \\subset ...$ is necessary for AdaQN to work. I have been through the proof and I was expecting that you would have to deal with a problem : at each outer loop iteration the points are \\textbf{not} sampled independently. How is that it does not appear in your proof ?\n- 13) Remark 4: Don't you omit the matrix inversions and the matrix vector product required by AdaQN when comparing it to Katyusha ? In other words, is this comparison of gradient complexity really fair between a first and a second order method ? \n- 14) How can you get a condition number which equals 1 in your experiments ? Normalizing can improve the condition number, but I have never seen such a bound related to just simple normalization.\n- 15) It is not clear what is monitored by \"time\" in your experiments. So I have been into the code and I noticed that the initialization which requires inverting the first hessian is not taken into account... In addition, SAGA is not initialized with a full gradient step, plus SAGA algorithm was launched with a decreasing step size which is unnecessary. This is one of the main advantage of VR methods. This is wat I really doubt about the fairness of the experiments.\n- 16) In all your experiments $N$ is at most of medium size, you should have tried on RCV1.binary for instance $N = 600K$ to see if first order methods are still performing poorly compared to AdaQN.\n- 17) Regularization parameters in table 2. look way to large... It is not representing the range of lambda used in practice. I would recommend $10^{-4}$ or $10^{-6}$. Moreover we could maybe see this way an experiment with large $\\kappa$\n\n\nQuestions:\n- 18) Why is AdaQN adaptive since you basically double the sample size at each iteration, so it's not dependent on anything else than the current number of samples m ?\n- 19) Why didn't you include L-BFGS in your experiments ? \n- 20) With is your initial point set to 1 in your experiments ?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Update after rebuttal and exchanges with the authors and the other reviewers**\n\nMain concerns I had about experimental settings, I think have been addressed. I think the authors must detail the experimental settings in the appendix such that the community can understand their numerical experiments and really be convinced that the settings are fair. \n\nDespite the discussion on the practical \"leveraging of superlinearity\", I finally decide to **increase my score** but only up **to 6**. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Final words**\n\nIn his updated review, reiewer RQBF wrote :\n\n>   [...] after a discussion with the authors I concluded that the BFGS Hessian updates have basically no effect on the complexity analysis.\n\nI agree with him on this point (and I think the authors too). Yet on my side, this discussion does not diminish the ideas nor the quality of the paper. Moreover, as I said above, my concerns about numerical experiments will be addressed in the final version of the paper (with fairer comparisons). My final thoughts about the paper are that despite this concern about superlinarity, it can be very profitable for the QN community and optimizers interested in adaptive mini-batch/sample size. \nHence, I increase my score to 7 and argue in favor of accepting this paper with one condition : a clear and important remark about this discussion on superlinearity must be added and highlighted.",
    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their feedback. The minor issues pointed out by the reviewer (typos, minor writing mistakes, ...) will be addressed in the revised paper. Next, we address the major comments raised by the reviewer.\n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 10:** Lack of comparison with other BFGS-like methods.\n\n**Response:** In our submission, we numerically compared AdaQN with a few BFGS-type methods, such as the original BFGS method and the stochastic quasi-Newton (SQN) method proposed in (A Stochastic quasi-Newton Method for Large-scale Optimization, Byrd et al. 2016). We thank the reviewer for mentioning (Practical quasi-Newton Methods for Training Deep Neural Networks, 2020) and (Stochastic Block BFGS: Squeezing More Curvature out of Data, 2016). We'll include these papers in the literature review of our paper and compare them with AdaQN numerically in the revised paper. Following your suggestion, we compared AdaQN with L-BFGS and summarize our results in the following paragraphs. Our experiments showcase the advantage of AdaQN with respect to L-BFGS.\n\n For the MNIST data set, to reach the training error of $10^{-4}$ each method requires the following number of passes over the dataset:\n\n AdaQN: 1.0 $\\quad$ AdaNewton: 0.8 $\\quad$ BFGS: 5.5 $\\quad$ L-BFGS: 5\n\n and the following convergence time (sec):\n\n AdaQN: 0.3 $\\quad$ AdaNewton: 0.2 $\\quad$ BFGS: 2.0 $\\quad$ L-BFGS: 1.3\n\n For the MNIST data set, to reach the test accuracy of $97$% each method requires the following number of passes over the dataset:\n\n AdaQN: 0.4 $\\quad$ AdaNewton: 0.3 $\\quad$ BFGS: 4.0 $\\quad$ L-BFGS: 4.0\n\n and the following convergence time (sec):\n\n AdaQN: 0.2 $\\quad$ AdaNewton: 0.1 $\\quad$ BFGS: 0.7 $\\quad$ L-BFGS: 0.6\n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 11:** My main concern is that the condition on $m_0$ is to my opinion completely undermined by the authors.  I'd have liked a clear explanation about what happens when we are facing a very ill-conditioned problem $\\kappa \\gg N$.\n\n**Response:** We'd like to mention that in several places in the paper we emphasize that our theoretical guarantees only hold for the case that $m_0$ is sufficiently large, and, hence, our approach is beneficial when the total number of samples $N$ is much larger than the lower bound on $m_0$. \n\nFor instance, in the abstract of the paper (line 13-14) we state that \"*We show that if the initial sample size is sufficiently large ....*\", and in the  introduction of the paper (lines 91-94) it reads \"*In our main theorem we show that $m_0$ is lower bounded by $\\Omega(\\max(d, \\kappa^2s\\log{d}))$, where .... . Hence, in this paper, we focus on the regime that the total number of samples satisfies $N \\gg \\max(d, \\kappa^2s\\log{d})$*\". Moreover, in our main theorem (Theorem 1, Equation (9)) we explicitly mention that $m_0$ should satisfy the condition   $ m_0 = \\Omega(\\max  (d, \\kappa^2s\\log{d} ))$. We even \n admitted this condition as one of the weaknesses of our paper in Section 6 (line 362 to 364), as we stated that \"*Our result shows AdaQN provably outperforms other benchmarks only in the regime that $N \\gg  \\max(d, \\kappa^2s\\log{d})$. This is due to the lower bound on the size of initial training set $m_0$.*\".\n \n As discussed above, the proposed method is beneficial when we are in the regime that $N \\gg  \\max(d, \\kappa^2\\log{d})$, and if this condition does not hold, for instance $\\kappa \\gg N$, then the size of the initial training set is larger than the total number of samples that we have access to and the proposed AdaQN becomes vacuous. We'd like to reiterate that we only claim a meaningful gain for AdaQN when we are in the regime of $N \\gg  \\max(d, \\kappa^2\\log{d})$. Please note that in many large-scale learning problems where $N$ is extremely large this condition holds. Although this point has mentioned in the original submission, we'll highlight it as a remark in the revised paper to address your concern.\n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 12:** Questions about the sample data dependency.\n\n**Response:** As mentioned in lines 114-155, sample points are drawn independently in our algorithm. Basically, when we aim to move from the setting with $m$ samples to the setting with $n=2m$ samples, we randomly pick $m$ new samples from the sample points that are not used so far and add them to the $m$ samples that we have used in the previous stage. This way, the samples are still i.i.d. and there is no correlation between the selected samples as has been shown in prior work on adaptive sample size methods, including Ada Newton in [19] and the BET algorithm mentioned by Reviewer RQFB. \n\nMore precisely, it will not lead to any issue as we assume that \"*all the expectations are with respect to the corresponding training set*\"; see lines 126-127. Therefore, for the training sets $S_m, S_n$ with $m < n$, where $ S_m\\subset S_n$, and their corresponding objective functions $R_m(\\mathbf{w})$ and $R_n(\\mathbf{w})$, we have\n\n$$\nE\\_{S\\_n}[R\\_n(\\mathbf{w})] = R(\\mathbf{w}),\n$$\n\n$$\nE\\_{S\\_n}[R\\_m(\\mathbf{w})] = E\\_{S\\_{n - m}}[E\\_{S\\_m}[R\\_m(\\mathbf{w})]] = E\\_{S\\_m}[R\\_m(\\mathbf{w})] = R(\\mathbf{w}),\n$$\n\nwhere $R(\\mathbf{w})$ is the expected loss function. In the revised paper, we will highlight this point in the proof of Proposition 1.\n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 13:** Remark 4: Don't you omit the matrix inversions and the matrix vector product required by AdaQN when comparing it to Katyusha?\n\n**Response:** This is a valid point. In our main theorem, when we report the overall complexity of the AdaQN method we mention that it requires computing one matrix inversion, $m_0$ Hessian evaluations, and  $3\\log(N/m_0)$ matrix-vector products. However, in Remark 4, when we compare AdaQN with Katyusha, we only compare their gradient complexity. The reviewer point is indeed valid, and in the revised paper, we will emphasize that the gradient complexity of AdaQN is better than Katyusha, while it requires evaluating an additional matrix inversion and some Hessian and matrix-vector product computations. It is worth noting that in many cases, the cost of computing a matrix-vector product is the same order as the cost of a single gradient computation. \n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 14:** Problems about the condition number in experiments. \n\n**Response:** We'd like to clarify that the problem condition number in our experiments is not $1$. In our experiments, we normalize the data points and as a result the smoothness parameter for all our problems becomes $L=\\mu+1$, where $\\mu$ comes from the regularization term and $1$ comes from the regression term with normalized data points. As a result, the condition number of the problem is $\\kappa = \\frac{L}{\\mu} = 1+\\frac{1}{\\mu}$. Hence, roughly speaking, the condition number scales as $\\kappa \\approx \\frac{1}{\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the regularization parameter and the strong convexity constant. Note that in our experiments, the parameter $\\mu$ is often small, and thus, the condition number is large. \n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 15:** Unfair and unclear in numerical experiments.\n\n**Response:** The reviewer is right about the problems in our numerical experiments. Following your suggestion, in our revised experiments, we incorporated the computation time of the first (and only) Hessian inversion in AdaQN. Moreover, we initialized the SAGA algorithm with a full gradient and hand-tuned a fixed step size for each dataset to obtain the best performance. After these modifications, we observed that the performance of SAGA improves and the convergence time of AdaQN becomes slightly worse, but their relative performance does not change significantly. This is mainly due to the fact that AdaQN requires only one matrix inversion. Next, we report the results of our new experiments on four datasets:\n\nConvergence time (sec) required to reach the test accuracy of $97$% for the MNIST data set:\n\nAdaQN: 0.2 $\\quad$ AdaNewton: 0.1 $\\quad$ SAGA: 1.0\n\nConvergence time (sec) required to reach the test accuracy of $90$% for the GISETTE data set:\n\nAdaQN: 1.8 $\\quad$ AdaNewton: 2.5 $\\quad$ SAGA: 4.0\n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 16:** The total sample size $N$ is small.\n\n**Response:** The largest dataset that we considered in our experiments is the Epsilon dataset with $80K$ samples, which is a relatively large dataset. But as the reviewer suggested, it would be useful to study the behavior of AdaQN on  larger datasets, such as RCV1 with $600K$ samples. We'll conduct such experiments in the revised paper.\n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 17:** Regularization parameters are small.\n\n**Response:** For our experiments, we tried different choices of regularization parameters for different datasets, and finally reported the one that led to best test error. In fact, selecting a smaller regularization parameter would increase the condition number of the problem and make AdaQN more favorable with respect to first-order methods. For instance, in the last experiment on Epsilon dataset where $\\mu$ is very small ($\\mu=10^{-4}$), the advantage of AdaQN is more significant. \n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 18:** The meaning of \"adaptive\".\n\n**Response:** The reason that we call our method \"adaptive\" is because the \"active sample size\" changes over time and we operate on different ERM problems throughout the training process. For this reason, as it has been named previously in the literature, we call it an \"adaptive sample size method\".\n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 19** Experiments of L-BFGS.\n\n**Response:** Thanks for your suggestion. Please check  our answer to Comment 10 to see the results for the L-BFGS method.\n\n$~$\n\n**Comment 20:** Problems about the initial point.\n\n**Response:** Note that in our experiments, to find an initial point that is within the statistical accuracy of the ERM problem with $m_0$ samples, we run multiple updates of gradient descent starting from the point $[1,\\dots,1]$. The output of this procedure is considered as the initial stage for all the algorithms. Hence, the choice of the first point $[1,\\dots,1]$ does not influence our empirical results.  We will highlight this point in the revised paper. ",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. Next, we briefly address the main issue raised by the reviewer. \n\n**Comment:** The mismatching of $m_0$ in experiments and the theory.\n\n**Response:** As the reviewer has correctly pointed out,  in our current theory, we  require the size of the initial training set $m\\_0$ to satisfy the condition $m\\_0 \\geq \\kappa^2\\log{d}$. As a result, we need the total number of samples $N$ to be larger than this lower bound to obtain a meaningful gain for AdaQN. On the other hand, our numerical experiments show that the initial sample size $m\\_0$ could be much smaller than the above threshold. As we mentioned in our submission, we believe that the main reason for this mismatch is the fact that the recent non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the BFGS method that we exploit in our analysis may not be tight, and there is room for improving this bound. Specifically, establishing a less strict condition on the initial Hessian approximation error of BFGS required for achieving a superlinear convergence rate could lead to a much smaller lower bound for the parameter $m\\_0$. \n\nAnother possible reason for the gap between our theory and experiments is that our analysis is the worst-case analysis and it studies a lower bound for $m\\_0$ that works for any setting. In other words, there could be some hard instances or corner cases that our current experiments do not capture, and for these hard instances we might need the number of samples required by our theoretical study. Identifying hard instances of empirical risk minimization problems for which a larger initial sample size is required is a future research direction that we plan to investigate.",

    "review": "Thank you to the authors for the response and the following discussion. The authors have clarified that superlinearity of BFGS is not needed to establish their results, and they promised to clarify this in the paper, which is good. They also promised to include in the future version of the paper a discussion and empirical results comparing to the prior work of [DMKVW18], which is appreciated. On the other hand, in my view a significant part of the technical novelty of the approach rested on the apparent reliance on the superlinear nature of the BFGS updates, but after a discussion with the authors I concluded that the BFGS Hessian updates have basically no effect on the complexity analysis. This weakens the paper in my view. Thus, all in all, I maintain my score.\n\nFirst, there is one important related work that is missing from the literature review, namely [DMKVW18]. In fact, that paper is to my knowledge the first to propose using adaptive sample sizes with a quasi-Newton method (in their case, L-BFGS). However, it does not provide a convergence analysis that is specific to any particular quasi-Newton method, which is the main contribution of the present submission. Instead, they show that if for each sample size an optimizer exhibits a convergence rate of at least, say, (1/2)^t, then one should double the sample size at each stage after a constant number of iterations (same as in the present submission). Thus, in principle, one could combine that result with the recent work on local convergence rates of BFGS [21-23] to establish a guarantee analogous to the one obtained by the authors. Of course, this is by no means straightforward, but it should at least be addressed in the submission. I would also be interested to see an empirical comparison of AdaQN with the BET method proposed by [DMKVW18] (ran with L-BFGS), since that can be considered as the closest baseline from the literature.\n\nSecond, I take issue with the claim that the proposed approach \u201cexploits the superlinear convergence\u201d of quasi-Newton methods. As the authors discuss, the superlinear convergence of BFGS takes the form of roughly (1/t)^t, where t is the number of iterations performed in one stage of Algorithm 1. However, since the algorithm performs only 3 iterations per stage, then it has no opportunity to exploit superlinear convergence, and all you actually obtain is linear convergence that is independent of the condition number. In fact, the proposed analysis demonstrates that the superlinear convergence doesn\u2019t really matter here, because we reach statistical accuracy before it kicks in. So, I think the authors should not say that the algorithm is \u201cexploiting the superlinear convergence\u201d, but it is ok to say that the algorithm is \u201cexploiting local convergence\u201d, because that is still very much accurate. \n\nThe above discussion about the lack of true superlinear convergence highlights another issue with the algorithm, namely, with the way that the Hessian estimate is being updated. Basically, what the authors propose is that every stage is initialized with the Hessian estimate computed from the smallest sample size (stage 1), then three iterations of BFGS slightly improve that estimate, and then it goes back to the original one. This seems strange. Why not continue with the improved estimate and keep updating it with the BFGS updates? The authors partially address this in Remark 1, pointing out that the initial Hessian estimate is good enough to ensure the local convergence phase of BFGS. But then what is the point of the three updates to the estimate? In fact, I\u2019m quite convinced that the convergence guarantee from Theorem 1 can be shown for the method that just uses the initial Hessian estimate without every updating it. But then, this is no longer BFGS or even quasi-Newton. This is why, in my view, the paper is to a certain extent misrepresenting the nature of why the proposed method achieves the convergence it achieves.\n\nOverall, the strategy of combining adaptive sample sizes with quasi-Newton methods is very interesting, and it is very nice to have a complete convergence analysis of an algorithm that follows that strategy. However, I do have some serious concerns regarding the novelty and presentation of this paper. I am open to reconsider the score if those concerns are addressed in the response.\n\n[DMKVW18] M.

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. Next, we briefly address the issues raised by the reviewer. \n\n**Comment:** Comparison with the BET method proposed in [DMKVW18].\n\n**Response:**\nFirst, we thank the reviewer for bringing this paper to our attention. Indeed, this paper is related to our submission, and we will discuss it in detail in the revised version of our paper. We would like to add that the  Batch-expansion training (BET) method in [DMKVW18]  differs from our proposed framework in terms of algorithm development and convergence analysis. Specifically, the BET method uses a similar idea of geometrically increasing the size of the training set while using the L-BFGS method for solving the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) subproblems. The authors leverage the *linear* convergence rate of the L-BFGS method to characterize the overall complexity of the BET algorithm. Importantly, since this work focuses on a linearly convergent quasi-Newton algorithm, the overall complexity of BET may not be better than the one for adaptive sample size first-order methods studied in the following paper: \n\nMokhtari, A. and Ribeiro, A. ``First-order adaptive sample size methods to reduce complexity of empirical risk minimization\". NeurIPS 2017.\n\nWe should emphasize that this is not a limitation of the analysis in [DMKVW18]. It is simply caused by the fact that the L-BFGS method converges linearly (even locally), similar to first-order methods. In fact, its linear convergence contraction factor is not provably better than the one for first-order methods. \n\nIn our submission, we leverage the local *superlinear* convergence rate of the BFGS method to improve the overall complexity of adaptive sample size first-order methods, and it also improves the sample complexity of BET. Our analysis heavily builds on the fact that the solution of the ERM problem with $m$ samples is within the superlinear convergence neighborhood of the BFGS method for the next ERM problem with $n=2m$ samples. As a result, BFGS solves each subproblem at a *superlinear* rate. Since we need to reach the statistical accuracy of each subproblem and there is no need to solve the subproblems exactly, we show that at most 3 iterations of BFGS is sufficient for solving each subproblem.\n\nAnother important point that we need to emphasize is that since the iterates of AdaQN are always in a local neighborhood in which BFGS converges superlinearly, we can always set the step size as $1$, while for BET this argument does not hold and proper selection of the step size (based on a the smoothness parameter or a line-search technique) is needed. \n\nIn our revised paper, we will discuss the BET method in the literature review of the paper and will compare it with our proposed method numerically. Our experiments during the rebuttal period show that BET performs well against first order methods (such as SAGA), but it underperforms compared to the proposed adaptive quasi-Newton method. Again, this is mainly due to the fact that, in each stage, the BET algorithm converges linearly while solving each subproblem, while the proposed AdaQN method converges at a superlinear rate. In the following paragraph, we summarize our experimental results:\n\nFor the MNIST data set, to reach the training error of $10^{-4}$ each method requires the following number of passes over the dataset:\n\nAdaQN: 1.0  $\\quad$    AdaNewton: 0.8  $\\quad$    BET: 2.5\n\nand the following convergence time(second):\n\nAdaQN: 0.3   $\\quad$   AdaNewton: 0.2  $\\quad$    BET: 1.0\n\nFor the GISETTE data set, to reach the training error of $10^{-4}$ each method requires the following number of passes over the dataset:\n\nAdaQN: 2.0 $\\quad$ AdaNewton: 1.8 $\\quad$ BET: 5.0\n\nand the following convergence time(second):\n\nAdaQN: 2.5 $\\quad$ AdaNewton: 4.5$\\quad$ BET: 6.0\n\n$~$\n\n**Comment:** AdaQN does not exploit superlinear convergence of BFGS.\n\n**Response:** We would like to emphasize that our algorithm development and  convergence analysis indeed exploit the local superlinear convergence rate of the BFGS method. Proposition 3 and Proposition 4 show that if the size of the initial training set is sufficiently large, then the solution of the problem with $m$ samples is within the superlinear convergence neighborhood of the problem with $n=2m$ samples. We use these results and the superlinear convergence ($O(1/k)^k$) of BFGS in the proof of Theorem 1 to show that running 3 iterations of BFGS is sufficient to solve each subproblem within its statistical accuracy. This point is discussed in detail in the proof of Theorem 1 (Appendix B5), and we briefly review this argument here as well. \n\nSuppose we are at the stage with $n=2m$ samples and the initial iterate $\\mathbf{w}\\_m$ is within the statistical accuracy of $R\\_m$. Further, suppose the size of initial set $m_0$ satisfies the required conditions, and as a result, $\\mathbf{w}\\_m$ is within the superlinear convergence neighborhood of BFGS for the ERM problem with $n=2m$ samples. \nIf we define $\\mathbf{w}\\_n$ as the output of the process after running $t\\_n$ updates of BFGS on $R\\_n$ with step size $1$, then based on the superlinear convergence rate of $O((1/k)^k)$, discussed in Proposition 2, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[R_n(\\mathbf{w}_n) - R_n(\\mathbf{w}^*_n)] \\leq 1.1 \\ \\left(1/{t_n}\\right)^{t_n}\\mathbb{E}[R_n(\\mathbf{w}_m) - R_n(\\mathbf{w}^*_n)].\n$$\n\nMoreover, based on Proposition 1, we have \n$\\mathbb{E}[R_n(\\mathbf{w}_m) - R_n(\\mathbf{w}^*_n)] \\leq 3V_m$. Combining these two inequalities implies that\n\n$$\n    \\mathbb{E}[R_n(\\mathbf{w}_n) - R_n(\\mathbf{w}^*_n)] \\leq 3.3\\ V_m \\left(1/{t_n}\\right)^{t_n}.\n$$\n\nOur goal is to ensure that the output iterate $\\mathbf{w}_n$ reaches the statistical accuracy of $R_n$ and satisfies\n$\\mathbb{E}[R_n(\\mathbf{w}_n) - R_n(\\mathbf{w}^*_n)] \\leq V_n$. This condition is indeed satisfied if the above upper bound is smaller than $V_n$ and we have \n\n$$\n     3.3\\  V_m \\left(1/{t_n}\\right)^{t_n} \\leq V_n.\n$$\n\nAs $V_n = \\mathcal{O}({1}/{n})$ and $n = 2m$, the above condition is equivalent to\n$\\left({1}/{t_n}\\right)^{t_n} \\leq ({1}/{6.6}) $. It can be verified that this condition holds if $t_n$ satisfies \n\n$$\nt_n \\geq 1 + \\ln{(6.6)}.\n$$\n\nThis expression shows that, in the stage that the number of active samples is $n$, we need to run BFGS for at most $t_n =3$ iterations (since $3 \\geq 1 + \\ln(6.6))$. Note that this threshold is independent of $n$ or any other parameters. \n\nThe above discussion shows that we do exploit the superlinear convergence rate of $O((1/k)^k)$  in our analysis to show that each subproblem can be solved using at most 3 iterations. \n \n$~$\n\n**Comment:** Why not continue with the improved Hessian estimate and keep updating it with the BFGS updates? \n\n**Response:** As the reviewer has correctly pointed out, one reasonable approach for initializing the Hessian inverse approximation for each phase is to use the last Hessian approximation matrix from the previous stage, instead of using the Hessian matrix of the initial set with $m_0$ samples. This is indeed a natural approach to consider, and we did investigate this direction previously, but for two reasons we did not use this idea and decided to go with the same initial Hessian approximation at each stage instead. \n\nFirst, we observed in our numerical experiments that using the Hessian approximation from the previous stage as the initial Hessian approximation for the next stage behaves similarly to our proposed AdaQN which uses $H\\_{m\\_0}^{-1}$ as the initial Hessian inverse approximation for each stage. \n\nSecond, we realized that theoretically we can not guarantee the last Hessian approximation from the phase with $m$ samples satisfies the conditions that we need for superlinear convergence of BFGS for the next subproblem with $n=2m$ samples. To be more specific, consider the case that we have $m_0$ samples in our active training set and we start our updates with the matrix $H\\_{m\\_0}^{-1}$. At the end of this process, we will end up with a new Hessian inverse approximation matrix which we here refer to as $\\tilde{H}\\_{m\\_0}^{-1}$. In BFGS analysis, there is no guarantee that if we follow the updates of BFGS the Hessian approximation improves and as a result we cannot ensure that $\\tilde{H}\\_{m\\_0}^{-1}$ is closer to the Hessian at the optimal point of the problem with $m_0$ samples compared to $H\\_{m\\_0}^{-1}$. Note that in the analysis of BFGS-type methods, we can only show that the descent direction improves, and it cannot be shown that the Hessian approximation improves as time progresses. Considering these points, we cannot show that if $H\\_{m\\_0}^{-1}$ satisfies the required condition for the initial Hessian approximation of BFGS the same holds for updated approximation matrix $\\tilde{H}\\_{m\\_0}^{-1}$. \n\nIn our analysis, we ensure that $m_0$ is sufficiently large so that $H\\_{m\\_0}$ satisfies the required initial Hessian approximation necessary for superlinear convergence of BFGS for ERM with $n$ samples for any $n>m_0$, i.e., $||H\\_{m\\_0} - \\nabla^2{R\\_n(\\mathbf{w}\\_n^\\ast)}||\\_F \\leq \\delta$. As discussed above, we cannot ensure that after a few updates on the Hessian approximation this bound improves and the updated Hessian approximation, denoted by $B_n$, will satisfy $||B\\_n - \\nabla^2{R\\_n(\\mathbf{w}\\_n^\\ast)}||\\_F \\leq \\delta$ or even the required condition for the next problem, which is $||B\\_n - \\nabla^2{R\\_{2n}(\\mathbf{w}\\_{2n}^\\ast)}||\\_F \\leq \\delta$. This is simply due to the fact that the error of Hessian approximation in BFGS does not provably decrease. We will highlight this point in the revised paper.",

    "comment": "Thank you for your helpful review. Here are our detailed responses.\n\n1. How the sliding window works. Thank you for asking this. The input is a sequence of n 2D coordinates, and we would like to generate the output sequence of the same length n, which can be produced parallelly (i.e., not sequentially). To get the i-th output, we have to send 2m+1 (m=30) points to the neural network, and we want them to be equally spaced. The (m+1)-th point (i.e., the one in the middle) in the input sequence is exactly the i-th input. We then start from the i-th input and walk both forward and backward along the input path (of n points), and we will get m points on both sides. By doing this resampling, the 2m+1 points can be used as the input to the neural network, so that the output is the i-th point in the output sequence. You may find more details in A.4 in the appendix, and please feel free to let us know if you have any further questions.\n\n2. The size of the design space. For extruder path planning, the size of the design space depends on the length of the desired fiber path. For training, the design space has a dimension of 292. For testing on the real printer, we used a longer desired path, whose design space has a dimension of 582. For the soft robot task, the dimension of the design space is 40.\n\n3. Generalization/future work. We will include more discussion about the generalization ability of our method, and future work. One promising direction is to investigate more complex neural network architectures of the encoder/decoder. For example, a generative encoder will be helpful if we need more than one design, and we can try RNN for designs with multiple parts and each part with continuous parameters, as mentioned by Reviewer PZD7.\n\n4. Loss function. Thank you for pointing this out. We would like to clarify that we did not use Chamfer distance for training, but using it as an evaluation criterion. We use the squared loss for neural network training (as in equations 6 and 9 in the paper). For the evaluation, we use Chamfer distance since it is more similar to human judgment on the similarity between two shapes than other criteria.\n\n5. Societal impact. We appreciate you for mentioning this. Our method provides much faster running time and at the same time without sacrificing much quality, which provides space for human-in-the-loop design, such that people only have to check the validity of the design or slightly adjust them. By doing this, we still need human labor and also provide better safety and reliability. We will include more discussion accordingly.",

    "review": "This paper is well written and addresses an interesting problem. The authors showed two concrete design and fabrication problems where the use of surrogate objectives is useful for overcoming lack of uniqueness in synthesis problems. The results presented in table 3 seemed to convincingly show that the author's method outperforms naive baselines on a soft robotics problem. \n\nThe soft robotics problem, in particular, was a good setting. And I quiet enjoyed reading about the difficulties that arise in PDEs with non-unique solutions at the boundary. This is a very real world problem with an interesting machine learning solution, and I think it is exactly the type of work we should encourage at this venue. \n\nOverall, the encoder-decoder architecture, such as it is, does not introduce anything new or interesting to the field. Indeed, the authors never make such claims. There are many alternative ways that the authors could go about this process, including adapting GAN-based and VAE-based approaches. Did the authors try any other approaches for their encoder-decoder architecture? Can you include a table with the dataset size and network parameters (optimizer, number of layers, etc)? I am a little confused about why the network took so long to train. \n\nThe data generation process also leaves something to be desired. Generating synthetic test data seems highly problem dependent. And the experiments in soft robotics in particular left me quite worried that the authors are just showing that a neural net can fit to a piecewise linear model. Or a simple piecewise convex model. With synthetic data, you always have to be quite careful that you're not simply investigating the ability of neural networks to approximate linear functions, etc. Although if Figure 4 is to be believed, it does seem like this works quite well in the real world. \n\n\nThe author's worked on interesting problems and developed a machine learning solution that significantly improves the final outcome. Surely, that's worth acknowledging. ",
    "comment": "Thank you for providing insightful feedback. Here are our detailed responses.\n\n1. Encoder-decoder architecture. Thank you for pointing this out. We agree with you that GAN/VAE-based approaches are very interesting to try, especially when we need multiple designs rather than one. We currently focus on generating one feasible design, which MLP is capable of, and GAN/VAE-based approaches can be very promising followup work.\n\n2. Long training time in extruder path planning. You may see the summary table below. As you already noticed, the training time of the encoder for path planning is relatively long (a few days), and the reason is we resample along the path to make sure points are equally spaced before sending them to the neural network, and this resampling process currently is not vectorized. This is an implementation issue specifically to the path planning task, which only affects the training time but not the inference time.\n\n```\nTask                  Extruder path planning    Soft robot\nDataset size          10,000 (paths)            40,000\n#MLP hidden layers    5                         3\nOptimizer             Adam                      Adam\n```\n\n3.

We actually tuned the MLP for different numbers of hidden layers and hidden sizes. We first tried different numbers of hidden layers (from 1 to 6), and then briefly tuned the sizes of each hidden layer. As we show in \u201c6. Linear encoder,\u201d the nonlinearity from MLP is necessary for the two tasks we investigated.\n\n5. Failure cases. Thank you for pointing this out. For example, for the soft robot task, as we can tell from table 4 in the paper, our method has a larger average distance to the target, although it might not be very easy to distinguish if we did not zoom in. We will provide zoomed-in figures to better illustrate the difference between the design of our method and \u201cdirect-optimization.\u201d\n\n6. Linear encoder. We agree this is an interesting ablation study that we can include in the paper. We train 3 linear encoders (i.e., single fully connected layer without activation function/nonlinearity) with different initializations. Note that for the surrogate, we still use MLP with 3 hidden layers such that it is still a reliable surrogate. As we can see in the table below, simply making the encoder linear significantly hurts the performance: about 11.5 times more frequently the robot collides with the obstacle, and the average distance to the target for successful cases is about 3 times as before. We therefore believe the nonlinearity provided by the neural networks is necessary for the soft robot task.\n\n```\nRegularizer weight = 0.05                           Number of successful    Average distance to the target\n                                                    cases (over 1,000)      on successful cases\nNon-linear encoder trained on non-linear decoder    975.0\u00b13.9               0.0464\u00b10.0018\nLinear encoder trained on non-linear decoder        710.7\u00b124.8              0.1324\u00b10.0276\n```\n\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful feedback. In summary, we would like to emphasize that:\n1) the chemistry problem is different due to the lack of good simulators; \n2) \u201cdirect-optimization\u201d is state-of-the-art for PDE-Constrained Optimization; \n3) our method resembles an autoencoder but is NOT an autoencoder; \n4) our method is not aimed at higher quality but good quality with extremely fast inference; \n5) there are a good variety of design tasks that our method can solve; \n6) we believe our method to be useful as long as it can work on certain tasks (as we already showed two and mention two new examples in the following rebuttal); \n7) compared to popular tasks like chemistry/biochemistry/rigid robots, we would like to bring methods and attention to less touched areas like 3D printing and soft robots so that they can all benefit from the ML community.\n\nHere are the detailed responses.\n\n1. Baselines do not reflect state-of-the-art. Thank you for pointing out these papers. We will include a revised, more thorough version of related work. However, we would like to argue 1) the chemistry problem is different from the problems we are solving; 2) \u201cdirect-optimization\u201d baseline is state-of-the-art for PDE-constrained optimization; 3) the approach of our work is different from the approaches in the papers you mentioned; our two-stage network is NOT an autoencoder.\n\nFirst, the chemistry problems you mentioned are different from the problems we are trying to solve in the paper. In small molecule chemistry, tools like density functional theory do allow a limited set of properties to be assessed, but nowhere near all of the functional properties researchers want to know for design.  Most biological activity properties of interest, as well as non-biological properties such as degradation time, must be assessed experimentally.  DFT and related methods are useful for energies and geometries of small molecules, but provide relatively limited information about reactivity.  Both papers you refer to used an autoencoder to reconstruct the chemical structures, and then used conditional approaches to generate new structures from the autoencoder\u2019s latent space.  In one of the papers you mention, Polykovskiy et al. (2018), two of the three properties they use are logP and SA, which are not simulations, but simple functions called from RDKit that are known to be of limited predictive value.  Note also that for small molecules, high-quality retrosynthesis tools are not widely available, compared to the questions we would like to study in which fabrication is straightforward. Indeed, in chemistry the synthetic accessibility question is almost as important as the functional one; a common experience in the small molecule design space is to generate molecules that computational chemistry techniques assess as promising, but no one knows how to make.  Proteins are of course often easier to synthesize, but, due to the scale of the problem, simulation of protein function is even harder than performing computational chemistry for small molecules. (In the paper you mention, Hawkins-Hooker et al. (2021), luminescence is evaluated experimentally and not via simulation.) Taken together, we think these issues make it clear that the drug design problem is drastically different from the problems we study in this work.  For the synthesis problems we are investigating, there exist high-quality simulators, so that we can build surrogate models for them, and close the loop by building an encoder based on the surrogate.\n\nSecond, \u201cdirect-optimization\u201d is the method proposed in Xue. et al. \u201cAmortized Finite Element Analysis for Fast PDE-Constrained Optimization\u201d, ICML 2020, which \u201coutperforms the traditional adjoint method on a per-iteration basis\u201d for PDE-constrained optimization. In our work, we demonstrate that our method has comparable performance to it, while being much faster. \n\nThird, our method resembles an autoencoder but is NOT an autoencoder, and our method is different from the papers you mentioned. Compared to the two papers you mentioned, which finds the representation of chemicals using an autoencoder aiming at minimizing the reconstruction loss, in our work, the surrogate of the physical realization process is explicitly learned, given high-quality simulators are available, and we train an encoder explicitly minimizing the cost function. With the input and the output space of our two-stage neural network to be (potentially) different, our encoder and decoder not being trained simultaneously (when training the encoder, the decoder is frozen), and not minimizing the reconstruction loss, we argue our approach is different from using an autoencoder.\n\n2. More realistic benchmark problems. Thank you for mentioning these papers. We would like to argue that 1) the papers you mentioned solve problems different from our paper 2) our approach does not need much special design for a specific task given a simulator/training data and a clear goal, and it is not aimed at providing designs with higher quality, but faster inference and reasonably good quality.\n\nFirst, in the soft robot case study, we deal with a continuum robot that, in theory, has infinitely many degrees of freedom, making the problem more difficult to solve, which is in the area of \u201csoft robotics\u201d. The mentioned papers solve problems with rigid robots composed of several one degree-of-freedom (DoF) modules.\n\nSecond, our approach can be easily applied to design tasks given simulator/training data and a clear goal. We only need to train two neural networks on the data and slightly tune the network hyper-parameters, without needing specially designed rules for the specific task. Besides, the methods in both papers run in seconds/minutes, while the inference time of our approach is milliseconds.\n\n3. Relevant papers from ML venues. Thank you for pointing these out, we will include more discussion on the difference between our method and other approaches. We want to emphasize that the papers you mentioned have a different focus compared to our work. In \u201cAutofocused oracles for model-based design,\u201d the main focus is on the gap between the surrogate and the real physical process, and in \u201cConditioning by adaptive sampling for robust design\u201d, the main focus is on non-differentiable oracle model and discrete design space, while our work (comparing to them) is using surrogate to select one feasible design from infinitely many feasible solutions.\n\n4. No theoretical result or practical insight. 1) As we mentioned above, \u201cdirect-optimization\u201d is the state-of-the-art method in PDE-constrained optimization, and we provide comparable performance to it while being significantly faster, which will be very helpful as the dimension of design space becomes larger. 2) We already proved the effectiveness of our method in two case studies, and our method can potentially be applied to more tasks (e.g., fluid problems and computer graphics problems mentioned in the next paragraph).\n\n5. Data generation can be difficult. Thank you for pointing this out. Configuration generation is beyond the scope of our paper, but we would like to argue there are still a great variety of real-world problems that we can solve given our current setting. Generating valid data within physical constraints can be challenging for problems like biochemistry, but for a vast range of other problems, this is not the case. For example, control problems in fluid mechanics (e.g., design external force with constraints on fluid speed) are widely studied, and building feasible datasets using high fidelity simulations is commonly accepted.  Similar problems have been studied within the field of computer graphics, ranging from art-directable physical simulation to computational fabrication.  Our method generalizes naturally to such problems.  More generally, domains in which the quality of a solution can be evaluated permit the use of techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to bias the sampling of data points (designs/realizations) to the region of high-quality solutions, making it feasible to generate large datasets efficiently.  Finally, even if the generated data fail to satisfy certain desiderata, our use of simulators permits these simulations to be run with no risk of physical damage, optimizing the ability of the surrogate to learn the behavior of the physical system near the constraint boundaries.\n\n6. Tasks with a great many objectives. Thank you for mentioning this. We agree we did not state the contribution of our method clear enough and will revise accordingly. Our method cannot work on every design problem, and we believe there is no universal method that can work on every design problem. We believe our method to be useful as long as it can work well on a certain type of task: has high-quality simulators, clear objectives, data generation not too difficult. We already proved its effectiveness on 3D printing path planning and soft robots (also potentially control problems in fluid mechanics). These are less touched areas compared to popular tasks like chemistry/biochemistry/rigid robots. We would like to bring solutions and attention to these neglected tasks and they can benefit from the ML community.",

    "review": "This is a clearly written paper on a timely topic.\n\nThe core contribution is the formulation factoring the evaluation of the design from the mapping of goals to designs, which breaks down the problem of many-valued mapping. Both parts are defined in terms of a differentiable module, so that the training can be achieved jointly. The evaluation methodology addresses what I would have expected to see - setting up baselines to show the extent to which each piece is relevant. So, one baseline asks how much is achieved by just mapping from goals to designs from historical data, while another asks how much is achieved by optimizing designs given the trained surrogate or decoder. \n\nI have only a few points of critique that I would have liked to have seen expanded in this paper. This is based on the acknowledgement that the technically arguments seem essentially sound to me, so my comments are mainly on formulation.\n\n(1) Building on the notion of multiple ways for a design to be good, many engineering designs have path-dependent constraints. For instance, while moving fast there may be a different cost to lateral deviations than when moving slowly. This is a combination of dynamics (something not considered explicitly in the examples) and other forms of heterscedasticity or path dependence. To the extent that the surrogate and the decoder are fairly simple MLPs, it is unclear if such phenomena can be handled. I think this is an important consideration, especially if the use cases include robotics and cyber-physical domains involving control.\n\n(2) While the introduction talks about considerations beyond the basic path, e.g., \"ease of manufacturing\" mentioned in sec 3, they do not feature later on. So, for instance, the soft body reaching problem could have been solved to some extent by multi-rigid body assumptions without seriously needing to acknowledge the infinite-dimensional space. On the other hand, there are design problems involving fundamentally different designs with discrete and continuous choices, e.g., multiple body morphologies involving soft components each (just for argument's sake). It is not clear if the proposed method would apply as described in these settings - calling for a clarification of generality and scope. \n\n(3) In the same vein, the design objectives here do admit a clear quantitative description always, e.g., distance from a desired path and reach error. There are many design problems where the objective is qualitative (e.g., any design from a topologically defined class will suffice). I expect that this might be easier to encode in this architecture but an example of this kind would have been helpful.\n\nIn summary, this is a clearly written paper whose methodology is sound. It would be stronger if the formulation's assumptions and limits are more clearly delineated.\n\n",
    "comment": "Thank you for your constructive review. Here are our detailed responses.\n\n1. Path-dependent constraints/multiple ways for a design to be good. Thank you for pointing this out. We agree that the quality of a design might not only depend on the final physical realization but also the design itself, so our cost function also takes the design as an input. For example, in 3D printing path planning, given the same printing result, we might want to prefer a design with a shorter printing time. Although we use a constant printing speed in our experiment, we can generalize our method to varying printing speed: we can change the inputs of our encoder/decoder to be equally spaced on time (i.e., the time difference between input coordinate i and input coordinate i + 1 to be identical). To do this, we will need to re-generate the dataset with paths with the extruder moving at a varying speed. Finally, the penalization of printing time can be easily added as a term in the cost function. For more complex tasks, we agree with you that more complex network architectures might be needed. For example, to generate polygon mesh, a graph neural network might be needed.\n\n2. Considerations beyond the basic path. Thank you for bringing this up. We agree with you that our method indeed can be generalized to problems involving rigid robots (discrete choices).\nThe proposed methodology remains the same, and we only need to modify the representations of data space as well as the architecture of the networks. On the other hand, we agree that in some cases, the design can be a combination of discrete and continuous choices, and we need more complex neural network architectures in this case. For example, for a design with multiple parts and each part with continuous parameters, our encoder/decoder can be recurrent neural networks (or other fancier models), which can consume/generate a sequence of data.\n\n3. Qualitative design objective. We agree that there are some objectives that are not easy to quantify. In this case, we incorporate its quantification process into the physical realization process/decoder/surrogate. For example, in 3D printing path planning, let\u2019s assume we want the extruder path to be visually appealing. To do this, we can collect people\u2019s scores on every extruder path in our dataset using crowdsourcing and train a neural network on it, predicting an \u201cappealing\u201d score.",

Both parts are defined in terms of a differentiable module, so that the training can be achieved jointly.

This is based on the acknowledgement that the technically arguments seem essentially sound to me, so my comments are mainly on formulation.\n\n(1) Building on the notion of multiple ways for a design to be good, many engineering designs have path-dependent constraints. For instance, while moving fast there may be a different cost to lateral deviations than when moving slowly. This is a combination of dynamics (something not considered explicitly in the examples) and other forms of heteroscedasticity or path dependence. To the extent that the surrogate and the decoder are fairly simple MLPs, it is unclear if such phenomena can be handled. I think this is an important consideration, especially if the use cases include robotics and cyber-physical domains involving control.\n\n(2) While the introduction talks about considerations beyond the basic path, e.g., \"ease of manufacturing\" mentioned in sec 3, they do not feature later on. So, for instance, the soft body reaching problem could have been solved to some extent by multi-rigid body assumptions without seriously needing to acknowledge the infinite-dimensional space. On the other hand, there are design problems involving fundamentally different designs with discrete and continuous choices, e.g., multiple body morphologies involving soft components each (just for argument's sake). It is not clear if the proposed method would apply as described in these settings - calling for a clarification of generality and scope.\n\n(3) In the same vein, the design objectives here do admit a clear quantitative description always, e.g., distance from a desired path and reach error. There are many design problems where the objective is qualitative (e.g., any design from a topologically defined class will suffice). I expect that this might be easier to encode in this architecture but an example of this kind would have been helpful.\n\nIn summary, this is a clearly written paper whose methodology is sound.

    "review": "Concern on the originality :\nThe lower bound of MAB pure exploration is proved in  [21], and most existing papers solve a lower bound optimization which is introduced in equation (1) at each round t. Such algorithms achieves the asymptotically optimal, but solving (1) at every round is  computationally inefficient.\nIn this paper, instead of solving (1) in each round as in [21], they propose an online iterative method to converge the optimal allocation of arm pulls \\omega^*.\nThis concept is already discussed in the work of [39], which performs an online lazy mirror ascent to solve a lower bound optimization (1). Their method can avoid computing (1) at every round since it is sufficient to compute at each steps only a subgradient to maximize the concave but not smooth objective function over the simplex.\n\nThe addition by this paper is to connect FW-algorithms with pure exploration problems for solving non-smooth functions. There is a surprising work of [42] that can be applied to solving non-smooth objective functions; this enables us to leverage the analysis of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in pure exploration bandit problems.\n\nTo sum-up, it is not so clear that this paper\u2019s contribution is significant. The drawback of the computational issue of [21] is already discussed in [39]. Best Challenger type algorithm is also not new, which was already introduced in [21].  Analysis for  non-smooth objective function by FW-algorithms is given by [42]. This paper combines those existing work\u2019s ideas but it is not really clear which part is the novel developed and what is the difficulty to  leverage them. \n\n[21] Aur\u00e9lien Garivier and Emilie Kaufmann.

    "comment": "Thank you for your comments. We will address them and revise our paper accordingly. Please find answers to your comments below. Reference numbers correspond to those provided in the supplementary material (long version of the paper).\n\n1. Comparison with [39]. [39] presents a gradient ascent algorithm for pure exploration problems. It is close in spirit to ours as we mention in the introduction. As also noticed in [32], to make LMA work, we need to tune its learning rate as a function of the unknown parameter $\\mu$ (which is impossible in practice). When using the learning rate proposed in [39], LMA is close to uniform sampling and has high sample complexity. BC has a much better performance than LMA even when applying a learning rate depending on $\\mu$ (as reported in our paper). Finally, we have to say that we are not sure about the theoretical performance guarantees of LMA for any structure, e.g., for Lipschitz bandits.\n\n2. Non-smooth FW algorithms. It is impossible to use the method of [42] for the generic pure exploration problems as there, the update requires the knowledge of the subgradient of $F_\\mu$ on the neighborhood of the current allocation. As already argued in [8], computing such subgradients is most often impossible. Our FW update circumvents this difficulty thanks to two non-trivial observations (i) Proposition 1 and (ii) the construction of r-subdifferential spaces. To the best of our knowledge, these observations are novel. \n\n3. Our contributions. Overall, we propose a new way to adapt the FW algorithm so that when used as a subroutine in BC, a pure exploration algorithm, BC has asymptotically optimal sample complexity for any kind of pure exploration problems in structured bandits. FW-based algorithms were mentioned in the literature earlier as a very efficient way of solving pure exploration problems, see e.g. [21] and [39]. We formalize and substantiate this observation.\nImportantly, we applied BC to different pure exploration problems, including BAI in linear bandits, and for the first time in the literature in BAI in Lipschitz bandits! \\\n\\\nNote that we do not claim that the lower bound on the sample complexity was a contribution of the paper since indeed, it can be established using standard technique. That is also why we present it in the introduction. \n",

    "review": "The paper argues that most prior work solves the optimization problem (1) at each round, which can be computationally expensive. To address this, they give an algorithm that just takes one step of Frank-Wolfe at each round instead.\n\nI found the assumptions 2 and 3 difficult to interpret. I think it would be useful to give more explanation in the main text on when these conditions hold, especially assumption 2. Given that prior work (e.g., [9]) has already solved this problem in such a generic setting, it would be useful to understand how restrictive assumption 2 is to compare to prior work. Are these assumptions strong enough to make the sample complexity result substantially weaker than prior work? Or are these assumptions relatively benign?\n\nThe authors say in lines 100-106 that the work of [29] is quite similar to the current work, except that LMA does worse empirically. Is this the only advantage of the current paper, superior empirical performance? I think it is important to distinguish the current paper from prior work more clearly so that the contribution is clear.\n\nThe authors write in line 56 that inner optimization problem in (1) can be hard. This was a bit unclear to me. Do they mean it is NP-hard or just intensive? Could examples be provided?\n\nBuilding on this, if the main advantage of the current work is being computationally lightweight, it would be useful to demonstrate this in experiments or examples of settings that are difficult for prior algorithms. Are there settings where the proposed algorithm does well, but existing algorithms do not scale to them? Essentially, are there problems that the current algorithm solves, but prior algorithms do not?\n\n\nAfter the rebuttal: thank you for the helpful clarification. I increased my score.\n",

(Note that [8] and [29] just applied their algorithms to very simple unstructured bandit problems). \\\nNext, we comment on the differences between our submission and [8] and [29]. The contributions presented in these papers are inspiring. Nevertheless, we believe that our submission brings interesting new insights and results.\n\n2. Comparison with [8]. We are unsure about the applicability of the algorithm proposed in [8] to any kind of structure. The authors of [8] themselves mention in [9] that an application of the algorithm in [8] does not work for linear bandits (see Page 2 right column of [9] -- Our guess is that the analysis of [8] would require the use of more involved concentration results than those presented in [8]). The authors of [19] also noticed that the algorithm of [8] is difficult to apply to combinatorial bandits. The algorithm proposed in [8] requires two zero-regret algorithms as subroutines, and it is not clear to us how to implement such algorithms for generic structure. Note also that the analysis of [8] requires that the mean rewards are bounded (Assumption 2 in [8]). Importantly, our algorithm, BC, outperforms the algorithm proposed in [8] in all problems we tested. Finally, note that [8] only evaluated their algorithms on simple unstructured bandit problems.\n\n3. Comparison with [29]. [29] presents a gradient ascent algorithm for pure exploration problems. It is close in spirit to ours as we mention in the introduction. As also noticed in [23], to make LMA work, we need to tune its learning rate as a function of the unknown parameter $\\mu$ (which is impossible in practice). When using the learning rate proposed in [29], LMA is close to uniform sampling and has high sample complexity. BC has a better performance than LMA even when applying a learning rate depending on $\\mu$ (as reported in our paper). Finally, we have to say that we are not sure about the theoretical performance guarantees of LMA for any structure, e.g., for Lipschitz bandits.\\\nAs a final remark, note that [8] and [29] only assess the performance of their algorithms for simple unstructured bandit problems.\n\n4. About Assumption 2 (A2). A2 is in general needed for the analysis of FW algorithms. Notice that A2.(i) is weaker than Assumption 1 in LMA [29] and Assumption 4 in [8]. Moreover, A2.(ii) is weaker than the standard assumption used in the analysis of FW, see e.g. [17]. As explained in Appendix C, A2 holds for most relevant pure exploration problems (the sufficient condition for A2 that we provide in Appendix C is very easy to check). Please finally observe that in [8, 29], the authors only verify their assumptions on easy-to-solve problems, actually only in unstructured bandits, while we checked A2 in unstructured bandits, linear, Lipschitz, and dueling bandits. \n\n5. About Assumption 3. As described in the proof sketch of Theorem 1 (Section 4.3), we need to ensure that the functions are continuous in $\\mu$. To conduct a non-asymptotic analysis of the sample complexity (i.e., Theorem 2), we need even stronger continuity results (at least Lipschitz continuity). The technical Assumption 3 allows us to upper bound the gradients of the functions $F_\\mu$ and of that defined in (11) (as it turns out, these gradients involve the gradient of the function d, hence Assumption 3). Usually, Assumption 3 is easy to verify, and all the problems discussed in Appendix D, E, F, G satisfy this assumption.\n\n6. Hardness of the inner optimization problem in (1). The hardness of this problem is difficult to evaluate and depends on the structure. We may imagine structures where it becomes intractable. Even for the case of Lipschitz bandits, solving this problem is not easy. We will look for yet harder structures. We note that to circumvent the difficulty of solving the inner optimization problem (1), we present in Proposition 1 an interesting new intermediate result that allows us to simplify the optimization problem leading to the optimal allocation. This result is exploited in the design of BC. \n\n7. Does BC solve problems that other algorithms cannot solve? As we discuss above, BC is the first algorithm that works well for Lipschitz bandits (LMA needs a learning rate that depends on $\\mu$). \n",

    "comment": "Thank you for your insightful comments. We will address them and revise our paper accordingly. Please find answers to each of your comments below. Reference numbers correspond to those provided in the main document (short version of the paper).\n\n\nMajor questions:\n1. Complexity of the algorithm BC. In each round, BC solves a small LP with m variables where m is the dimension of the r-subdifferential space. We do not have guarantees on m but experiments suggest that it remains small \u2013 see Appendix D Fig. 1 where 40% of the time $m=1$ for unstructured bandits, and Appendix E Fig. 3 where m is almost always equal to 1 for linear bandits. For Lipschitz bandits, we re-run our experiments, and in about 70% of rounds $m=1$; we will add these results in the paper.\\\n\\\nIn comparison, in the case of Best Arm Identification (BAI) in unstructured bandits, the TaS algorithm [13] and LMA [29] have a complexity equal to $O(K\\log(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^2))$ (where $\\epsilon$ is the precision of the binary search algorithm used to compute the update) and O(K) per round, respectively. For the gamification approach [8], the time complexity mainly depends on the two regret minimization algorithms used as subroutines. The paper [29] provides a precise account of the complexity of various baseline algorithms (see Appendix B in [29]). From the above discussion, it is difficult to compare the complexity of the various algorithms analytically. We will provide results from experiments: BC has a similar running time as TaS but worse than LMA.\\\n\\\nIn the case of BAI in structured bandits, it is still difficult to compare the running time of various algorithms analytically.  However, BC is the only algorithm with strong theoretical and empirical performance guarantees and good running time. In linear bandits, all the presented algorithms are fast. LT-H [18] is the fastest but has a much higher sample complexity than BC; BC is faster than LinGame and LinGame-C [9]. In Lipschitz bandits, LMA [29] is faster than BC and BC is faster than TaS. But, as also noticed in [23], to make LMA work, we need to tune its learning rate as a function of the unknown parameter $\\mu$ (which is impossible in practice). When using the learning rate proposed in [29], LMA is close to uniform sampling and has high sample complexity. In addition, we are not sure about its theoretical performance guarantees for Lipschitz bandits. \n \n2. Avoiding the forced exploration phase. When the curvature remains bounded (e.g., in most threshold bandit problems), forced exploration can be avoided and upper confidence bounds as [5] can be used instead. When the curvature may become infinite, we need to exploit the specific structure of the problem to be able to remove the forced exploration phase. For example, for BAI in linear bandits, we only need to explore each dimension as done in [26].\n \n\nMinor comments:\n\n\u2022\tLT-H is defined in Appendix E L748, and stands for Lazy Track-and-Stop with a heuristic stopping rule introduced in [18] (see Appendix A.1 of NeurIPS version). For convenience, we will add this definition in the main paper.\n\n\u2022\tWe will add LinGapE but omit RAGE since it is outperformed by LT-H [18]. \n\n\u2022\tWe will make the proposed modifications.\n\n\n\nTechnique-related comments:\n\n\u2022\tLine 240: Then it should be defined as 0.\n\n\u2022\tLine 990: We will include $\\{\\hat{\\mu}(t-1)\\in \\Lambda}$ into the good event.\n\n\u2022\tLine 1012: Yes\n\n\u2022\tProposition 3: Infinity norm.\n\n\u2022\tLine 1171: $|| z \u2212 x ||_{\\infty}^2$ should be removed\n\n\u2022\tLine 1277: Our upper bound in Theorem 2 is conservative because it is valid for any structure. We can leverage specific structures to derive tighter results. For example, for BAI in linear bandits, we only need to explore each dimension as done in [18] \u2013 and in turn we hope to remove the dependency in the number of arms.\n",

I think the authors did a nice job of interpreting best challenger from Garivier & Kauffman as a frank-wolfe step and find a way to do it right.\n* I feel the experiments are quite biased in that the baseline methods are missing a few popular algorithms including RAGE, LinGapE, and ALBA.  For the unstructured problem, lil ucb and LUCB are missing.

However, it seems to require solving the linear program. Could the authors discuss the time complexity of the algorithm? For pure exploration problems, It seems to be worse than TaS.\n* Please add a discussion on the significance of Theorem 2 in the main content of the paper.

I could guess but I would appreciate if the definition of $\\Lambda$ is more explicit.\n* Assumption 3: is \\forall symbol missing in front of $\\pi \\in \\mathcal{S}_{i^*(\\mu)}$?\n* L290: con() was defined as con{}.\n\n----\n(after rebuttal)\nI am mostly satisfied with the rebuttal. I now remember that lil'ucb was evaluated in \"Best-arm identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits in the fixed confidence setting\" and was empirically shown to be worse than LUCB in practical regimes anyways. But it would be great to have that remark in the final version.\n\nFor Assumption 3, I understand it now. I rephrase and expand the sentence to make it easier to read. ",
    "comment": "Thank you for your insightful comments. We will address them and revise our paper accordingly. Please find answers to each of your comments below. Reference numbers correspond to those provided in the main document (short version of the paper).\n\n1. About our experiments for linear bandits. The idea was to compare the performance of our algorithm, BC, to that of algorithms with the same theoretical guarantees, namely with instance-specific asymptotically optimal sample complexity. That is why we compared BC to algorithms in [9] and [18] only. This choice was also motivated by results presented in [10] and [18]: in [10], the authors evaluate the performance of RAGE, LinGapE, and ALBA, and show that RAGE outperforms the others; whereas in [18], LT-H is shown to be better than RAGE (hence we kept LT-H and omitted the other algorithms). We are currently running all algorithms and plan to report their performance in the paper. \n\n2. Experiments for unstructured bandits. In [13], the authors compare their algorithm, TaS, to LUCB, and show that TaS exhibits better performance. That is why we omitted LUCB. About lil\u2019 UCB, almost all existing works do not consider this algorithm, but we can add it. \n\n3. Experiments in general and their role in the paper. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a generic algorithm with asymptotically optimal instance-specific sample complexity, whatever the underlying structure and the pure exploration task are. We illustrate the versatility of our approach on several difficult structured bandits (linear bandits and for the first time in the literature, Lipschitz bandits). Note that the two other papers [8] and [29] with the same objective as our paper just evaluate numerically their algorithms on easy-to-solve problems, actually only in unstructured bandits!\n\n4. Implementation complexity of BC. Indeed, BC solves a small LP in each round with m variables where m is the dimension of the r-subdifferential space. We do not have guarantees on m but experiments suggest that it remains small \u2013 see Appendix D Fig. 1 where 40% of the time, $m=1$ for unstructured bandits, and Appendix E Fig. 3 where $m$ is almost always equal to 1 in linear bandits. For Lipschitz bandits, we re-run our experiments, and in about 70% of rounds $m=1$; we will add these results in the paper. Hence, BC is very fast for structured bandit problems, whereas for unstructured bandits, its running time is close to and sometimes better than that of TaS (TaS has a complexity equal to $O(K\\log(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^2))$, where epsilon is the precision of the binary search algorithm used to compute the update). We will include the empirical running time of all algorithms in the paper.\n\n\n5. About Theorem 2. To the best of our knowledge, the only attempts to devise algorithms with both (i) asymptotic instance-specific optimal sample complexity and (ii) non-asymptotic sample complexity guarantees for generic pure exploration problems are reported in [8] and in the present submission. Our analysis is valid for any structure; this versatility does not seem to be shared by [8], since as mentioned in [9] (the same authors as in [8]) and [19], the analysis in [8] is not applicable to linear and combinatorial bandits. As you noticed, the second term in our sample complexity upper bound scales exponentially in $K$, but it is the result of the application of crude concentration inequalities. By exploiting specific structures, we believe we can improve this dependency.  \n\nMinor points:\nDefinition of $\\Lambda$. We will clarify. It is defined around L30. This is the set of all possible parameters. The set captures the structure of the problem if any; it is a usual way of encoding the known structural properties of the problem. \n\nL136, L151-L152, L290: Thanks for noting these. We will modify accordingly.\n\nAssumption 3: No, $\\pi$ is some vector in $\\mathbb{R}^K$ satisfying L352.\n",

    "comment": "Thanks for reviewing our work and giving constructive feedback. We answer your questions below:\n\n---------------\n\n> (1) Throughout the paper, it is mentioned that the dataset is diverse, but I do not see any metrics of diversity of the dataset. It seems misleading to claim diversity without providing any support for it. Also, the paper does not have any mention of ethical concerns or societal impact. Given that such a dataset was created, especially using personal VLOG style videos, this seems like it should have some discussion.\n\nWe mention the dataset is `diverse` as it is collected from less constrained video sources, in comparison to existing datasets mostly built on videos associated with a fixed set of video categories. For example, YouTubeHighlights [32] are based on videos from 6 categories (e.g., `surfing`), ActivityThumb [37] and ANetCaptions [14] are collected based on 200 human action classes. In contrast, our videos are from general domains, i.e., \u2018daily vlog\u2019. It is shown in [Fouhey et al.] that this collection procedure leads to greater diversity in terms of actions. In Table 1, we also present some analysis on unique verbs and nouns in the dataset, which shows the videos used in the dataset are very different across domains.\n\nFouhey et al. From lifestyle vlogs to everyday interactions.CVPR  2018.\n\n\n\n\n---------------\n\n> (2) The dataset is also fairly small by current standards, 10,000 videos is not many.\n\nWe do not aim to provide a very large amount of data due to the high cost of human annotation, (e.g., in supplementary Section B, annotating 10K videos already costs around $16,000, which is a large amount for an academic budget). Meanwhile, as we have seen recent trends [citations 22, 21, 17] on utilizing large-scale weakly aligned web videos for pre-training and then fine-tuning on human-annotated data, we aim to provide it as a well-annotated dataset mainly for evaluation purposes. We also noticed this dataset itself might not be enough to train large or complex models, thus we utilized weakly supervised pre-training via ASR captions, as stated in Section 4.3, L242-248.\n\n\n\n---------------\n\n> (3) The proposed baseline approach is fairly straightforward adaptation of existing approaches, like DETR to videos. There is some value in seeing it work and providing a good baseline for the new dataset. It would also be good to compare the proposed baseline to previous works on other, existing datasets to help make comparisons.\n\nTo our best knowledge, we are the first to use Moment-DETR in the video domain. It is worth noting that Moment-DETR does not come free to the video domain. There are a few key challenges to make it work, e.g., adding a loss (saliency loss) that explicitly encourage the learning of similarity between clips and queries, in Table 4, we show saliency loss is critical to good performance, note that this is also true when we do not use the saliency annotation -- by removing the saliency annotation term (t_low/t_high) from the saliency, we see adding this loss still significantly improve the model performance:\n\n| saliency loss type | Moment Retrieval |         | Highlight Detection |       |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------|-------|\n|                    | R1 @0.5           | mAP avg | mAP                 | HIT@1 |\n| None               | 44.84            | 25.05   | 17.84               | 20.19 |\n| t_out/t_in only        | 52.9             | 31.46   | 35.62               | 52.58 |\n\n\n\nTo better compare Moment-DETR with existing methods, we also tested Moment-DETR on CharadesSTA [cited in paper as 6], test split:\n\n| Method                              | R1 @0.5 | R1 @0.7 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| CAL [Escorcia et al. arXiv 2019]    | 44.9   | 24.37  |\n| 2D TAN [Zhang et al.

CVPR 2021], which appears on arXiv after the NeurIPS deadline). Note that this is our initial trial during the tight response period, we expect better performance when Moment-DETR is properly tuned. When pretrained with a small scale of 10K videos (this pretraining is efficient, only ~8 hours with a single RTX 2080Ti), Moment-DETR\u2019s performance is further improved. Besides, we also notice Moment-DETR\u2019s performance on R1 @0.7 is not as good as R1 @0.5, suggesting it may be less accurate in localizing the exact temporal boundaries, we see similar observations in QVHilights and is mentioned as a limitation of the work that needs future investigations (L284-291).\n\n\nEscorcia et al.

Sorry for the confusion and we will add it back to the main paper given the extra page in the final version.\n\n\n\n\n---------------\n\n> There is some discussion on the limitations of the proposed pretraining, but otherwise there is no discussion on the limitations of the approach or dataset and no meaningful discussions on the societal impacts of the dataset.\n\nWe discussed two limitations on our approach: (1) L242-244: requiring larger-scale data for training; (2) L284-292: Moment-DETR performs quite well on low IoU threshold, but its performance on higher IoU threshold is relatively lower, e.g., compared to XML+, Moment-DETR shows a clear advantage on R1 @0.5, but only achieves a similar performance on R1 @0.7. We will make this clearer.\n\nFor societal impacts, we believe the tools developed using our dataset might have an educational impact, where teachers as well as students can study and analyze long videos of entire weeks/semesters to find specific query-related salient parts of the classroom interactions (to improve the teaching quality for teachers, and to re-study later after class for students or for students who missed classes). We\u2019ll add discussions in revision.\n\n\n---------------\n\n> The paper does raise a few potential ethical concerns, regarding the dataset. The dataset consists of \"over 10,000 YouTube videos, covering a wide range of topics, from everyday activities and travel in lifestyle vlog videos to social and political activities in news videos\"\nThis is concerning because it can provide annotations that could be used to violate privacy (e.g., using personal vlog videos) or enabling other agencies to use this data to build models to understand vlog-style videos for undesirable purposes. Also having societal and political activities (e.g., protests as mentioned in the paper) in the data could be used for undesirable surveillance purposes. Given that there are protests, there could also be violent imagery in this dataset (not mentioned if this has been removed or not).\n\n\nWe only use public videos from YouTube. To use these videos, we rely on Fair Use (https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/), as indicated in supplementary file L22. We also plan to restrict the use of the data for research purposes only by having users sign an agreement. Overall, we aim to collect a dataset that is general enough to cover a wide range of activities, thus we collected a set of videos out of several video domains, including popular news topics, such as weather and some social activities. During this process, we also explicitly removed videos that contain improper content, such as these containing violent imagery.\n",

    "comment": "Thanks for reviewing our work and giving constructive feedback. We answer your questions below:\n\n---------------\n\n> Line 259-260 'we define a prediction to be positive if it has a high IoU with one of the ground truth moments'. It is not very clear here whether 'one of the ground truth moments' means one from 3 annotators or one from disjoint moments.\n\nIn our final dataset, for each video, we only have a single set of moment annotations. Thus 'one of the ground truth moments' means one from disjoint moments. Also note that we do have 3 sets (from different annotators) of moments for 600 query-video pairs, but these are only used for verifying that our annotations are of high user agreement (L125) and are not intended to be used anywhere else.\n\n---------------\n\n> For highlight detection: Line 262-263, 'we have ground-truth saliency scores from 3 users, we evaluate performance against each then take the average'. Does it mean the model's performance is dependent on the inter-user agreement?\n\nFor HIT@1, we define a prediction to be correct if it matches with one of the ground-truth annotations among the three. This metric is useful when considering the subjectiveness of highlights for different users and it only evaluates the highest scored prediction. \n\nFor mAP, we first evaluate each annotation and take the average. This metric considers more about how the models perform globally. Since it takes the average of results for the three annotations, it also considers the inter-user agreement, as you mentioned.\n\nIn conclusion, the two metrics focus on different aspects of and using both of them allows for a more comprehensive evaluation. Sorry for the potentially confusing description and we will add details in revision.\n\n\n\n---------------\n\n> The results from using only CLIP and Slow-Fast networks as visual encoder, as in how important the temporal information is in the two tasks.\n\n|                    | Moment Retrieval |         | Highlight Detection |       |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------|-------|\n| video feature type | R1 @0.5           | mAP avg | mAP                 | HIT@1 |\n| CLIP only          | 53.23            | 30.58   | 35.51               | 55.87 |\n| SlowFast only      | 52.06            | 30.54   | 35.85               | 56.71 |\n| CLIP+SlowFast      | 53.94            | 32.2    | 35.65               | 55.55 |\n\nOverall, using CLIP or SlowFast alone shows similar performance on moment retrieval, and is slightly worse than using both of them, suggesting they are complementary for this task. For highlight detection, using SlowFast feature performs better, but the difference is small. \n\n\n---------------\n\n> Performance on moment retrieval after the model is pre-trained via ASR, to see how much improvement has supervised training brought.\n\nThe pretraining only results on QVHighlights test split:\n\n|                        | Moment Retrieval |         | Highlight Detection |       |\n|------------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------|-------|\n| method                 | R1 @0.5           | mAP avg | mAP                 | HIT@1 |\n| pretraining only       | 3.44             | 0.7     | 26.53               | 32.23 |\n| finetuning only        | 52.89            | 30.73   | 35.69               | 55.6  |\n| pretraining+finetuning | 59.78            | 36.14   | 37.43               | 60.17 |\n\nWe notice supervised training/finetuning (row 3 vs. row 1) brought a huge gain to both tasks. This is expected as (1) the languages in annotated queries (declarative sentences referring to specific actions/objects, etc.) are very different from the free-form monologues or dialogues in the ASR; (2) The ASR text may be only weakly related to the videos. Meanwhile, we see the pretraining only model achieves quite low performance on moment retrieval but reasonably good results on highlight detection. This may indicate, though it failed to precisely locate the queries, the model learned to align the queries and the video clips that share similar meanings.\n\n\n\n---------------\n\n> Evaluation of SoTA models on moment retrieval which have official implementations online: 2D-TAN[1], DRN[2], CBP[3]\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We ran 2D-TAN model on QVHighlights dataset, the test split results are shown below\n\n| method            | text feature | visual feature | R1 @0.5 | mAP avg |\n|-------------------|--------------|----------------|--------|---------|\n| 2D TAN            | GloVe        | SlowFast+CLIP  | 32.81  | 22.46   |\n| 2D TAN            | CLIP         | SlowFast+CLIP  | 35.86  | 27.22   |\n| Moment-DETR       | CLIP         | SlowFast+CLIP  | 52.89  | 30.73   |\n| Moment-DETR w/ PT | CLIP         | SlowFast+CLIP  | 59.78  | 36.14   |\n\nUnder a fair comparison, using the same features, we notice Moment-DETR (row3) shows a clear advantage over 2D-TAN (row2). We\u2019ll add more results in revision.\n\n\n---------------\n\n> Since one advantage of the dataset is having queries matching disjoint moments, how well can the baseline model spotting all the disjoint moments given a query, is there a metric to evaluate it?\n\nYes! We follow [2] to use mAP for evaluating predictions, this metric takes into account multiple moments during evaluation. This is also similar to how object detection is evaluated (one image may contain multiple objects of interest). \n\n\n---------------\n\n>  Table 1 shows the dataset has a wide range of granularity in the verbs (e.g, cut and report) and nouns(dog and weather), does the performance of the baseline model varies by the granularity?\n\nYes, the performance on different video domains vary. In the table below, we categorized the test split performance (Table 3) by grouping queries into one of the 3 domains, the percentage of queries in each domain are shown in the brackets. We show results for Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) for all the baselines. Overall, we notice the performance on `daily` and `travel` domain are higher than `news`. This may be from (1) different granularity as you suggested; (2) data size in the domains.\n\n|                   | MR R1 @0.5  |                |              | HD HIT@1      |                |              |\n|-------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|\n| Method            | daily (46.5%)  | travel (43.1%) | news (10.4%) | daily (46.5%) | travel (43.1%) | news (10.4%) |\n| BeautyThumb       | -              | -              | -            | 24.13         | 17.44          | 20.62        |\n| DVSE              | -              | -              | -            | 21.90         | 21.50          | 22.50        |\n| MCN               | 8.23           | 14.44          | 13.12        | -             | -              | -            |\n| CAL               | 24.83          | 26.92          | 22.50        | -             | -              | -            |\n| XML               | 45.05          | 40.45          | 33.12        | 58.58         | 53.08          | 49.38        |\n| XML+              | 49.37          | 46.62          | 35.00        | 57.18         | 54.44          | 48.12        |\n| Moment-DETR       | 51.80          | 56.57          | 42.50        | 56.15         | 56.93          | 47.62        |\n| Moment-DETR w/ PT | 63.22          | 59.08          | 48.63        | 60.27         | 61.95          | 51.75        |\n\n\n\n---------------\n\n> While the highlights are labelled on a five-point scale, is that only the 'very good' ones are used in training and evaluation?\n\nFor training, we use all scores. In L234, we mentioned we construct a pair with a high score clip and a low score clip. For evaluation, in the paper we only reported performance with `>= Very Good`, but we do have results for `>= Good`, and `>= Fair`, etc. and our evaluation script (in supplementary file) supports evaluating scores at all scales. We hope this could be useful for future work for more detailed analysis. Due to space limits, we only report the most strict one, i.e., `>=Very Good`. \n\n\n> Related work: [4] uses a DETR-like architecture for temporal detection, and treat the task as a set-prediction task.\n\nThanks for mentioning this related work. We noticed [4] uses similar DETR-like architectures detecting a fixed set of actions and their corresponding temporal locations, and in this work we focus on detecting the temporal locations of unconstrained language queries from the videos. [4] works on pure video, while this work requires learning from both video and language. We will cite it and add more discussions in revision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "review": "## Strengths \n\n- The paper is clearly written\n- The dataset is going to be useful to the community as it seems it is quite high quality (based on the description and the rater agreement). \n- I believe that the introduced method MomentDETR is a good extension to the DETR approach for moment retrieval in videos. \n- The pre-training strategy on weakly supervised data with ASR is interesting and leads to a substantial improvement.\n\n\n## Weaknesses\n\nOverall the paper is good but there a few points that could improve it further:\n\n- **Weakly supervised pretraining**: The weakly supervised pretraining seems to bring a substantial gain in performance (Table 3). However from what I understood, only a small dataset is used for this pretraining (only 5.4K videos). Have you thought about using larger datasets for this pretraining? How would that impact the performance of the method? One could for example use the HowTo100M dataset for that [22]. I believe that a scale study would be very valuable there even if not scaling to the full HowTo100M dataset (e.g. providing the performance with only 2.5K videos and 10K videos to see the impact of increasing the size of the pretraining). The VLOGs dataset [a] could also be used for that purpose.\n\n- **MomentDETR evaluation**: MomentDETR is an interesting method in itself. For that reason, I think it would be worthwhile to run MomentDETR on other moment retrieval benchmarks to show it is competitive on known benchmarks. I think one of the main issue of the paper is that it introduces a new dataset and a new method so it is hard to convince the reader that the method is indeed better than pas work such as [30,19,12,4,16] as we cannot compare direclty to some numbers provided in these papers. I do trust the authors for having run these baselines properly but I think that running the method on other datasets would increase the strength of the paper.\n\n- **Precision about the saliency loss**: \n  - How are $t_{high}$ and $t_{low}$ defined based on the scores from 1 to 5?  \n  - How important is the term using low/high versus the term using out/in. Could you provide an ablation about this in Table 4 (keeping all other elements i.e. L1/gIoU and CLS)? If the term low/high is indeed important that would justify more the need for annotating individual frames which is one of the specificity of the QVHighLights dataset.\n\n- **Highlight and saliency score**: Some frames within positive annotated segments are annotated as `Very bad` (and `Bad`) for the given query. This seems to contradict that these frames are indeed positive for that query. In that case why not removing these frames all together from the annotation and create more moments? It would also be useful to provide the score distribution (% of frames that receive a score of 1,2,3,4,5...). \n\n- Minor typos:\n  - L79: lsmiting -> limiting\n  - L100: sailiency -> saliency\n  - L326: detetcion -> detection\n\n- Missing related work:\n\n  - [a] From lifestyle vlogs to everyday interactions. Fouhey et al. CVPR18\n\n## Overall assessment \n\nOverall the paper makes good contributions. However I believe that these contributions could be strengthen following the advices provided in the weaknesses section. For now I lean towards acceptance and I am ready to increase my score if some/all concerns are addressed during the rebuttal.\n\n\n## Post rebuttal\n\nAfter reading other reviews and the author's response I am happy to support acceptance of this paper. I really encourage the authors to include all the new ablations and set of experiments requested by the reviewers as they will make for a stronger paper, which in turn will be more influential in the community.

    "comment": "Thanks for reviewing our work and giving constructive feedback. We answer your questions below:\n\n\n\n------\n\n> Weakly supervised pretraining: The weakly supervised pretraining seems to bring a substantial gain in performance (Table 3). However from what I understood, only a small dataset is used for this pretraining (only 5.4K videos). Have you thought about using larger datasets for this pretraining? How would that impact the performance of the method? One could for example use the HowTo100M dataset for that [22]. I believe that a scale study would be very valuable there even if not scaling to the full HowTo100M dataset (e.g. providing the performance with only 2.5K videos and 10K videos to see the impact of increasing the size of the pretraining). The VLOGs dataset [a] could also be used for that purpose.\n\nThanks! We followed your suggestion and performed the pretraining experiments using 2.5K and 10K HowTo100M videos. We show their finetuning performance on QVHilights val split:\n\n|                    | Moment Retrieval |         | Highlight Detection |       |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------|-------|\n| pretraining videos | R1 @0.5           | mAP avg | mAP                 | HIT@1 |\n| None               | 53.94            | 32.2    | 35.65               | 55.55 |\n| 2.5K HT100M        | 54.58            | 32.82   | 36.27               | 56.45 |\n| 10k HT100M         | 56.06            | 34.16   | 35.97               | 56.84 |\n| 5.4K QVHighlights  | 59.68            | 36.3    | 37.7                | 60.32 |\n\nWe notice that adding HowTo100M videos for pretraining (row 2,3) improves performance on both moment retrieval and highlight detection. But the improvement is smaller for the highlight detection task compared to that of the moment retrieval task. Meanwhile, when increasing 2.5K videos to 10K videos, we see a positive trend on moment retrieval, but the highlight detection performance stays similar. Potentially due to the size of HowTo100M videos we use are still relatively small. We expect a larger pre-training corpus to significantly improve these results. \nAnother observation is that, when pretraining on same-domain videos, i.e, QVHighlights videos, a small 5.4K videos shows significantly better results than using 10K out-of-domain HowTo100M videos. This suggests the importance of pretraining on same or closer domain data.\n\n----------------\n\n> MomentDETR evaluation: MomentDETR is an interesting method in itself. For that reason, I think it would be worthwhile to run MomentDETR on other moment retrieval benchmarks to show it is competitive on known benchmarks. I think one of the main issue of the paper is that it introduces a new dataset and a new method so it is hard to convince the reader that the method is indeed better than pas work such as [30,19,12,4,16] as we cannot compare directly to some numbers provided in these papers. I do trust the authors for having run these baselines properly but I think that running the method on other datasets would increase the strength of the paper.\n\nTo address this issue, we tested Moment-DETR on CharadesSTA (cited in paper as [6]). Results are shown below:\n\n| Method                              | R1 @0.5 | R1 @0.7 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| CAL [Escorcia et al. arXiv 2019]    | 44.9   | 24.37  |\n| 2D TAN [Zhang et al. AAAI 2020]     | 39.7   | 23.31  |\n| CBP [Wang et al. AAAI 2020]         | 36.8   | 18.87  |\n| DRN [Zeng, et al. CVPR 2020]        | 45.4   | 26.4   |\n| VSLNet [Zhang et al. ACL 2020]      | 47.31  | 30.19  |\n| IVG-DCL [Nan et al. CVPR 2021]      | 50.24  | 32.88  |\n| Moment-DETR                         | 52.12  | 29.84  |\n| Moment-DETR w/ HT100M 10K videos PT | 54.06  | 31.32  |\n\nWhen trained from scratch, Moment-DETR is competitive compared to the baselines, with the best R1 @0.5 (+~2% compared to IVG-DCL [Nan et al. CVPR 2021], which appears on arXiv after the NeurIPS deadline). Note that this is our initial trial during the tight response period, we expect better performance when Moment-DETR is properly tuned. When pretrained with a small scale of 10K videos (this pretraining is efficient, only ~8 hours with a single RTX 2080Ti), Moment-DETR\u2019s performance is further improved. Besides, we also notice Moment-DETR\u2019s performance on R1 @0.7 is not as good as R1 @0.5, suggesting it may be less accurate in localizing the exact temporal boundaries, we see similar observations in QVHilights and is mentioned as a limitation of the work that needs future investigations (L284-291).\n\nEscorcia et al.

We\u2019ll add these details in revision.\n\n\n----------------\n\n> How important is the term using low/high versus the term using out/in. Could you provide an ablation about this in Table 4 (keeping all other elements i.e. L1/gIoU and CLS)? If the term low/high is indeed important that would justify more the need for annotating individual frames which is one of the specificity of the QVHighLights dataset.\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we did another set of ablation studies. The results are:\n\n| saliency loss type | Moment Retrieval |         | Highlight Detection |       |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------|-------|\n|                    | R1 @0.5           | mAP avg | mAP                 | HIT@1 |\n| None               | 44.84            | 25.05   | 17.84               | 20.19 |\n| out/in only        | 52.9             | 31.46   | 35.62               | 52.58 |\n| low/high only      | 52.52            | 30.35   | 29.32               | 40.77 |\n| low/high + out/in  | 53.94            | 32.2    | 35.65               | 55.55 |\n\nOur observations are (1) row2,3 vs. row1: adding either one of the terms improves performance on both tasks; (2) row4 vs. row2,3: adding both terms leads to the best overall performance; (3)row4 vs. row2: adding low/high term on top of out/in improves performance on highlight detection HIT@1 by ~3% absolute, while mAP stays similar. Meanwhile, adding it also gives slightly better results on moment retrieval. These observations show the usefulness of the term low/high. Also note that, as a baseline, we only explored a simple strategy to use the highlightness annotations (see the answer to the last item), we expect further improvement if more advanced approaches are used.  \n\n\n----------------\n\n> Highlight and saliency score: Some frames within positive annotated segments are annotated as Very bad (and Bad) for the given query. This seems to contradict that these frames are indeed positive for that query. In that case why not removing these frames all together from the annotation and create more moments? It would also be useful to provide the score distribution (% of frames that receive a score of 1,2,3,4,5...).\n\nDuring moment annotation, we performed a verification experiment (see L124-129), we found the annotated segments/moments have a very high inter-user agreement, which suggests a high quality of these moments. After we collected the saliency scores, we did another analysis, i.e, the score distributions, We noticed 94.41% of the annotated clips are rated by two or more users as `fair or better` (>=3, meaning they may be less saliency, but still relevant, see supplementary file Fig 6). Only 0.96% of the clips have two or more users rated as `very bad`. This result is consistent with our earlier moment verification experiments. Since only a tiny percentage of the annotated segments/moments are truly irrelevant, they do not hinder the use of the data. Thus we choose to keep and release the data in its current form. \n\nScore distribution:\n(since we have scores from 3 users for each clip, we show the score percentage as two or more users agree, e.g., for 5.59% of the clips, two or more users agree they should be rated as equal or lower than `bad`.)\n\n| score range     | %     |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| <=1 (very bad)  | 0.96  |\n| <=2 (bad)       | 5.59  |\n| <=3 (fair)      | 23.44 |\n| <=4 (good)      | 62.1  |\n| <=5 (very good) | 100   |\n\n\n----------------\n\n> Minor typos:\n\nThanks! We will fix these typos.\n\n\n----------------\n\n> Missing related work: [a] From lifestyle vlogs to everyday interactions. Fouhey et al. CVPR18\n\nThanks! We will add this citation.\n ",

    "comment": "Thanks for reviewing our work and giving constructive feedback. We answer your questions below:\n\n\n\n------\n\n> line 114: During data collection, how do you segment raw videos into short clips? Is it random or based on specific criteria?\n\nWe segment the raw videos sequentially. Besides, we also follow [Lei et al.] to remove the first 60 seconds of the raw videos, as these contents are often subscription pleas, etc.\n\nLei et al. What is more likely to happen next? video-and-language future event prediction. EMNLP 2020.\n\n---------\n\n> In table 4, can you explain why removing L1 or gIoU losses decrease the highlight detection performance?\n\nThey do not actually affect the highlight detection performance significantly. The results are indeed similar if we consider the variance across runs -- we performed 5 random runs of row 2-4, here are their highlight detection mAPs respectively, mean (std, standard deviation): 35.68 (0.47), 36.54 (0.26), 35.95 (0.48), we notice the difference between row 4 and row 2, row 4 and row 3  are not significant considering their standard deviation.\n\n---------\n\n> Can TVR and ANetCaptions datasets help in pre-training the MomentDetr model? (removing HD related losses)\n\nThanks for your suggestion! Due to time constraints, we used another dataset (10k videos from HowTo100M [Miech et al.]) for pretraining. We show its finetuning performance on QVHighlights val split:\n\n|                    | Moment Retrieval |         | Highlight Detection |       |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------|-------|\n| pretraining videos | R1 @0.5           | mAP avg | mAP                 | HIT@1 |\n| None               | 53.94            | 32.2    | 35.65               | 55.55 |\n| 10k HT100M         | 56.06            | 34.16   | 35.97               | 56.84 |\n\nWe notice that using 10k HowTo100M videos with ASR for pretraining improves performance on both moment retrieval and highlight detection. Since weakly labeled out-of-domain data helps in pretraining the model, we expect that using well-annotated datasets such as TVR, ANetCaptions will also give better results. We will add more results in revision.\n\nMiech et al. Howto100m: Learning a text-video embedding by watching hundred million narrated video clips.

For instance, how will it perform on the TVR dataset in comparison to SOTA?\n\n\nHere we experimented with another popular moment retrieval dataset, CharadesSTA (cited in paper as [6]) to demonstrate Moment-DETR\u2019s generalization ability. Test split results are shown below:\n\n| Method                              | R1 @0.5 | R1 @0.7 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| CAL [Escorcia et al. arXiv 2019]    | 44.9   | 24.37  |\n| 2D TAN [Zhang et al.

CVPR 2021], which appears on arXiv after the NeurIPS deadline). Note that this is our initial trial during the tight response period, we expect better performance when Moment-DETR is properly tuned. When pretrained with a small scale of 10K videos (this pretraining is efficient, only ~8 hours with a single RTX 2080Ti), Moment-DETR\u2019s performance is further improved. Besides, we also notice Moment-DETR\u2019s performance on R1 @0.7 is not as good as R1 @0.5, suggesting it may be less accurate in localizing the exact temporal boundaries, we see similar observations in QVHighlights and is mentioned as a limitation of the work that needs future investigations (L284-291).\n\n\nEscorcia et al.

We first compute the similarity scores using CLIP features between each sampled frame and the query, then use TAG [Zhao et al.] (backed by the classical watershed algorithm [Roerdink et al.]) to group top-scored frames into moments. Moment retrieval results on test split are shown below as `CLIP zero shot`:\n\n| Method            | R1 @0.5 | mAP avg |\n|-------------------|--------|---------|\n| CLIP zero shot    | 16.88  | 7.67    |\n| Moment-DETR       | 52.89  | 30.73   |\n\nAs noted in this table, without training on the target dataset, CLIP\u2019s results are reasonable, but still far below the performance of Moment-DETR. \n\nZhao et al., Temporal action detection with structured segment networks.

    "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful feedback!\n\n- Regarding whether the examples are more of \"out-of-distribution\" than \"adversarial\", we believe this is not the case due to the following two reasons:\n   - Using the answer vocabulary from the Pythia model for the VQA 2.0 dataset, one can achieve 77.2% on the AdVQA validation set. This number is 48.46% for the TextVQA validation set, suggesting that the answer distribution for AdVQA is indeed not \u201cout-of-distribution\u201d, as it is for TextVQA. Furthermore, in Table 3, the best amongst the current state-of-the-art models only gets around 33%, which is far lower than 77.2%, suggesting that there is more at play here than just distributional differences corresponding to lower numbers.\n   - To confirm that AdVQA is indeed not solvable by models which can use scene text, we evaluate M4C [23] on AdVQA in Table 3 and observe a performance gain of only 4%. The gain is actually higher when trained on VQA 2.0 compared to TextVQA, suggesting that AdVQA is more in-domain to VQA compared to TextVQA.\n- Comparison with OKVQA, TextVQA and VQA-CP? \n   - In contrast to other VQA datasets which either target a very specific failure mode for VQA models or reorganize data distribution to reduce impact of bias, in AdVQA we create a more holistic and general dataset to make VQA more challenging. Specifically, compared to (i) OKVQA in which questions specifically require external knowledge, (ii) TextVQA requiring scene text reading and understanding, and (iii) VQA-CP specifically changing answer distribution between train and test splits, we don\u2019t ask annotators to specifically target a fixed failure mode or artificially generate an unbiased question distribution (which can be problematic, as raised by Reviewer bpjd) but take a more holistic model-in-the-loop approach. Asking annotators to fool an existing VQA model covering all of these failure modes and biases (and more) makes AdVQA more suitable to be the next generation of a generic VQA benchmark, in our opinion. That said, having these alternative benchmarks has helped certainly push progress and put a magnifying lens on very difficult failure modes individually - together with AdVQA these datasets can help build better VQA models in the future. We will include a more detailed discussion in the final version, if accepted.",

It is perhaps not surprising that performance is lower on AdVQA, however, it is impressive that it has higher human agreement than the non-adversarial VQA. The magnitude of how much models drop in performance is significant (at least this reviewer): from the 70% range to 33% at most. It seems like this could be a great addition in the community (assuming it is released, etc.) for modeling work on VQA-V2 to report on AdVQA in addition.\n\nThe qualitative analysis is insightful and much appreciated (to this reviewer). \n\nThe additional experiments are helpful. Interestingly, the discussion at L222 (suggesting that performance goes up just a little bit if finetuned on val) seems qualitatively different to trends with other datasets. For instance, in a lot of past work (e.g. Adversarial Filtering (from Le Bras et al ICML 2020 and earlier works)) one round of 'fooling the model' is shown to be not enough. However, it's great that it works here (possibly though because val is small).\n\nThe limitations and broader impact sections could be somewhat improved (see the next section).",

    "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful comments. We absolutely agree that it is important to be cautious, with any kind of benchmark but especially with stress tests, and we appreciate your concerns around potential dataset bias. We agree that the new dataset may be overfitted somewhat to the model that was used in-the-loop during data collection. Our response to this potential issue is twofold:\n\n1) If the dataset was in fact overfitted to a particular model with highly specific \u201cshortcuts\u201d, the examples would not fool the other models. Instead, we find that all models consistently perform very poorly on the dataset. This suggests that any potential shortcuts are at least present in all of the models we tested, which is a quite large range of models.\n\n2) One of the beauties of dynamic adversarial data collection is that it explicitly acknowledges that no dataset is perfect: if any bias exists or emerges, annotators and researchers will be able to exploit it eventually, which will lead to better models that can then be put in the loop for further data collection. In this sense, the mechanism we employ can address biases much more cleanly than alternatives like the VQA-CP benchmark you mentioned. That said, to our knowledge, no construction-specific characteristics exist in AdVQA which can be exploited like in VQA-CP.",

    "review": "`Missing discussions on related VQA stress test datasets`\n\nThere are many other VQA datasets built upon VQA v2 to stress test VQA models. For example, VQA-LOL [1], VQA-Introspect [2], IV-VQA/CV-VQA [3]and VQA-Rephrasings [4]. I suggest the authors to add discussions about these works, to highlight the key differences and contributions in AdVQA.\n\n[1] Tejas Gokhale, Pratyay Banerjee, Chitta Baral, and Yezhou Yang. Vqa-lol: Visual question answering under the lens of logic. ECCV, 2020.\n\n[2] Ramprasaath R Selvaraju, Purva Tendulkar, Devi Parikh, Eric Horvitz, Marco Ribeiro, Besmira Nushi, and Ece Ka- mar. Squinting at vqa models: Interrogating vqa models with sub-questions. CVPR, 2020.\n\n[3] Vedika Agarwal, Rakshith Shetty, and Mario Fritz. Towards causal vqa: Revealing and reducing spurious correlations by invariant and covariant semantic editing.\n\n[4] M Shah, X Chen, M Rohrbach, and D Parikh. Cycle- consistency for robust visual question answering. In CVPR, 2019\n\n`L34-35, AdVQA probably is not the first work to have human adversarial approach in Multimodal space`\n\nVLEP [5] is a related work in video+language domain, which leverages human-and-model-in-the-loop to collect harder event candidates for future event prediction task. I suggest the author to add discussion about this work.\n\n[5] JieLei, Licheng Yu,Tamara L Berg, and Mohit Bansal. What is more likely to happen next? video-and-language future event prediction. In EMNLP, 2020\n\n`Detailed question type analysis`\n\nIn ANLI, the authors have provided detailed analysis on the collected adversarial statements (Table ?? and Section ?? of ANLI) to provide insights on (1) What kind of statements would successfully attack the model and (2) Distribution of different failure cases to understand what human annotators focuses on when attacking the model. \n\nI see that some statistics are provided in Figure 5/6 and Table 5. However, I would be more interested in analysis on detailed question types that is similar to Section ?? in ANLI. \n\nFor example, since \"Other\" questions contribute to more than 40% of AdVQA questions, are these other questions more about testing model's reasoning skills or about recognition of small/novel objects in the image. What kind of reasoning questions are there? Are there more positional reasoning than relational reasoning?\n\n`Answers in AdVQA`\n\n(1) L222-224 suggest that the low performance can be from the answer distribution differences between training and testing data. When further finetune on AdVQA val set, what's the performance on VQA v2?\n\n(2) I also want to understand how much does the answer distribution shift contribute to the low performance.\n\nFirst, there are questions that are not answerable by VQA v2 answer vocabularies. What's the upper bound of model performance on val and test set if using the VQA v2 answer vocabularies in Pythia?\n\nSecond, can we keep adding more training data from AdVQA and see when does the model performance saturate? This may not be easy as no training set is collected for AdVQA. Maybe we can keep a smaller set of test set aside and use all others as training data. I will be happy to discuss more about this point.\n\n`BERT performance on AdVQA`\n\nBERT performance on AdVQA test set seems to be on par with multimodal models. Does this suggest that the multimodal models are not paying attention to the visual signals at all? Or at least it is not paying attention to the image regions that really matters to answer the AdVQA questions. Maybe some visualizations of attention maps could be helpful to understand this result.\n\n`Differences between AdVQA and ANLI`\n\nAdVQA largely follows ANLI, but differs in several data collection settings. I hope to learn from the authors about the reason behind these differences.\n\n(1) Human generated adversarial training data is provided in ANLI, but not in AdVQA. As L222-224 suggested, the training data may be helpful in improving performance on AdVQA.\n\n(2) ANLI was collected for multiple rounds, but AdVQA only collect one round. This point is somewhat related to (1). Without training data, we could not have a stronger model for the second round of attack. \n\n(3) ANLI include diverse context from multiple domains, while AdVQA collects on images from COCO only\n\n`Best Practice with AdVQA`\n\nAs the VQA v2 performance is saturating. Would it still make sense to report VQA v2 performance, or should the future work just report results on AdVQA? What about the other stress test dataset? ",
    "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful comments, this is great feedback that will help make the paper better!\n\n* We are sorry that we missed citing the VQA stress tests you mention, and we will add them to the final version if accepted. The efforts you mentioned check for robustness along specific axes (e.g., consistency in logic, to question paraphrases, etc.). In AdVQA we have a more holistic and general dataset of questions that push the boundaries of SOTA models in general. In that sense, we take these datasets to be complementary.\n* L34-35: We will rephrase accordingly and cite the papers you mention, thanks for pointing them out!\n* Regarding more detailed analysis of the question types: this is a great suggestion, thanks! Below we provide our insights from our analysis based on your suggestions and the discussions in the paper. We will expand this analysis and add it in the final version if accepted.\n   - Using Rosetta [6] extracted OCR tokens, we find that 15.4% of the val questions are solvable using OCR, suggesting that some of the AdVQA questions require scene text reading and understanding capabilities.\n   - Here is a detailed breakdown of question types based on the categories similar to [3]. We specifically check for the category\u2019s presence at the start of the question:\n```\nQuestion Type | full val set (%) | \u201cothers\u201d (%)\nwhat is       | 20.67            | 36.48\nwhat color    | 4.61             | 9.16\nwhat kind     | 1.41             | 2.79\nwhat are      | 2.01             | 3.80\nwhat type     | 1.44             | 2.87\nis the        | 8.57             | 1.48\nis this       | 0.98             | 2.33\nhow many      | 25.28            | 0.27\nare           | 4.09             | 0.82\ndoes          | 2.15             | 0.16\nwhere         | 0.84             | 1.66\nis there      | 0                | 0\nwhy           | 0.04             | 0.01\nwhich         | 0.59             | 3.38\ndo            | 0.51             | 0\nwhat does     | 2.05             | 4.07\nwhat time     | 1.23             | 2.41\nwho           | 0.59             | 1.16\nwhat sport    | 0.13             | 0.27\nwhat animal   | 0.48             | 0.97\nwhat brand    | 1.41             | 0.28\n```\n    - We also sampled 50 random examples from the validation set to check what capabilities AdVQA questions require for answering. If more than one category is required for answering the questions, we include the question in all those categories. The categorization is based on the answer (i.e., what answering the question requires), rather than the question. Based on our analysis, we can see that AdVQA does require multiple kinds of reasoning capabilities in a model to solve it:\n        - 7 questions required color understanding.\n        - 12 questions\u2019 answers were common objects (80 common object classes in COCO)\n        - 15 questions required reading or understanding text for answering\n        - 12 questions required positional understanding and reasoning.\n        - 4 questions required understanding uncommon objects\n        - 7 questions required external knowledge in some form.\n        - At least 6 questions were directly solvable by common sense reasoning.\n\n- Answers in AdVQA: as an upper bound using Pythia\u2019s vocabulary on AdVQA, as discussed in L278-282, 77.2% of AdVQA val set\u2019s questions are answerable using Pythia\u2019s vocabulary suggesting that answer distribution difference might not be a major contributing factor to low performance as the current state-of-the-art models\u2019 performance is very far away from 77.2% as even the best model in our Table 3 only achieves 33.33%.\n\n- BERT performance on AdVQA: Thank you for your suggestions. In comparison to multimodal models, BERT is very good at picking up on  natural \"biases\" in AdVQA, which it probably learns from its pretraining on large scale text corpora. As seen in Table 4, the category-wise performance of BERT compared to multimodal is different as multimodal models perform better on numbers and others category while lagging on yes/no category. BERT\u2019s performance is similar to majority class performance and majority class performance on all categories suggesting that BERT picks up on the dataset biases very well. We confirm this by doing an extensive analysis on BERT and VisualBERT\u2019s predictions on AdVQA and we will include this analysis in the the final version if accepted: \n\n   - 68.4% of the times BERT predicts \u201cno\u201d majority answer compared to 49.6% of the times for VisualBERT when the question is of \u201cyes/no\u201d type.\n   - For numeric questions, 56.3% times BERT predicts majority answer \u201c2\u201d whereas VisualBERT only predicts it 33.3% times.\n   - For questions requiring reading text (keywords \u201cwritten\u201d, \u201csign\u201d, \u201ctext\u201d), BERT mostly predicts \u201cstop\u201d.\n   - For questions related to brand BERT mostly predicts \u201cnike\u201d.\n   - For countries, BERT mostly answers \u201cusa\u201d.\n   - For color, mostly predicts \u201cblack\u201d \n   - For questions asking what the person is holding predicts \u201ctennis racket\u201d.\n   - For cities, BERT mostly predicts \u201cnew york\u201d. \n\n- Differences between AdVQA and ANLI:\n   1) The main reason for this was budget: this dataset was already very expensive to create. For similar budgetary reasons, the ANLI training dataset is actually not fully validated (see section 2.1 of the paper), which means that their training data is not necessarily of the best quality and may need to be filtered.\n   2) We agree! We hope to do multiple consecutive rounds in the future. Even without training data, we think the community should be able to train up more robust models that can do well on this dataset, which can then be put in the loop for further data collection.\n   3) The main reasons for sticking to COCO were licensing and accessibility: the community knows where to find COCO images and how to handle them. We appreciate your suggestion of exploring other domains, and we hope to be able to do this in subsequent rounds of data collection.\n\n- Best Practice with AdVQA: This is an excellent question. We would say that people should still report VQAv2 results, for the simple reason that we don\u2019t want models to improve AdVQA performance *at the expense of* VQAv2 performance. We would encourage the community to report results on as many stress tests as possible.",

    "review": "I have found the article to be clearly written, with impressive numerical benchmarks, and a nice balance between exposition of the theory, of the algorithms, of the theoretical and numerical results. Though I did not go through the proofs in the appendix, the latter nicely complements the main body of the article.\n\nMajor comments:\n-\tClipping: Since for indefinite kernels the strong topology is given by $k_++k_-$, have the authors tried flipping the coefficients ($\\alpha_i\\rightarrow |\\alpha_i |$) instead of clipping them? In the synthetic/numerical experiments, can the authors show the number/magnitude of the coefficients that where clipped? I expect that, since kernels are understood in GPs as generating the covariance matrices, few negative coefficients should appear when fitting the synthetic curves. Could you remind the reader why negative definite covariance matrices cannot be considered in GPs as to explain why a clipping has to be introduced? It seems to me that in ``Learning the Kernel with Hyperkernels`` the discussion after Lemma 7 rules indefinite kernels out only because the authors have decided to focus on RKHSs rather than RKKSs. I thus imagine that the reasons for clipping differ between the kernel and GP communities.\n-\tSynthetic experiments: In Figure 2 and in the appendix, all the functions appear to have a non-zero mean. In kernel ridge regression (KRR), this would make the task much more difficult for the RBF/SE/Gaussian kernel and I am wondering if this may explain the failure of the SE kernel with this characteristic downward form sticking to zero in the area without observations. Can the authors repeat the synthetic experiments when normalizing the curves to have zero mean? While the choice of a linear kernel is classical, for these types of signals, it would be more adapted if there were some linear trends. Here it just seems to skew the confidence intervals. I believe that if the x-axis was centered to zero, then the weight assigned to the linear kernel would be close to null.\nOverall, the Matern 3/2 kernel seems to produce confidence intervals very much alike the ones of the KFO. This begs the question of plotting the kernel of the KFO (for instance by showing $y\\mapsto k(x,y)$ for several $x$). Does it recover some translation-invariant features of the data? All the experiments seem to focus exclusively on regression, would the KFO procedure be able to recover the covariance/kernel of a dataset that would be generated with zero mean and covariance some given kernel $k(x,y)$? Can an experiment be done in such a direction?\n\nMore generally, since $\\lambda$ was managed to be chosen in $[0,1]$, would there be techniques to sample the kernels exclusively in the cone of positive definite kernels? As said above, I liked the article and am willing to upgrade my mark depending on the authors' answers.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n7 I would suggest citing the Ong et al. 2005 paper directly in the abstract since it serves as the main source for the procedure\n\n110 Hilbert with uppercase\n\n119  ``Learning the Kernel with Hyperkernels`` (Lemma 7) could be quoted with profit to justify for the finite decomposition. Or do the authors only intend to give examples of the type of indefinite kernels contained in $H_\\kappa$? I very much appreciated the discussion of paragraph 109-120 which denotes a good knowledge of the existing literature.\n\n207 this should be a $\\succcurlyeq$\n\n209-214 It is not clear to me why EVD was presented on 196-208 if not used (this contradicts 194 by the way). If the techniques of 196-208 are just quoted as other possibilities that are dismissed, then it should be stated more clearly.\n\n225 Euclidean with uppercase\n\n240 Formulation of Definition 3 is convoluted. I would suggest \u201cif there exists\u201d rather than \u201csuch that there exists\u201d and to write $f:H_\\kappa \\rightarrow H_\\kappa$ to make explicit input and output spaces (same for Theorem 2).\n\n241 Why underline the kernels? They have the same interpretation as the ones of Eq. (5).\n\n244 The kernel $k$ is a kernel over the hyper-RKHS, using $k$ here can be confusing. Maybe change it to $\\Bbbk$ or any preferred notation?\n\n319 In Table 1, what is $\\dagger$ referring to?\n",
    "comment": "We appreciate our reviewer's patience, time and effort to provide us detailed feedback and raise few interesting points. Please see\nbelow our replies to the key points raised.\n\n* _\"Have the authors tried flipping the coefficients ($\\alpha_i\\rightarrow|\\alpha_i|$) instead of clipping them?\"_\n\n    Yes, we did but we had not included these in the current version to avoid potential confusion. The fundamental reason to choose spectrum clipping $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=[{(\\alpha_i)}_+]$ instead of spectrum flipping $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=[|\\alpha_i|]$ is that the magnitude of change observed in the transformed matrix is smaller for spectrum clipping. The negative log-likelihood estimates (along with its standard deviation) for GP Regression using both clipping and flipping are listed in Table 1. It is clear from the results\nthat clipping is always better than flipping and in some cases substantially so.\n\n**Table 1**: GP Regression results in terms of negative log-likelihood and its standard deviation (lower the better). \n\n      |    Dataset    |   Fertility  |     Yacht    |      Slump   |    Boston    |      Auto     |\n      |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n      |    KFO_FLIP   |  5.28 \u00b1 2.74 | \u221213.15 \u00b1 5.4 | \u22122.97 \u00b1 1.48 | \u221216.6 \u00b1 7.03 |  \u22128.21 \u00b1 3.6  |\n      |    KFO_CLIP   |  5.15 \u00b1 2.95 | \u221234.66 \u00b1 1.6 | \u22123.01 \u00b1 1.7  | \u221224.7 \u00b1 4.2  |  \u22128.78 \u00b1 1.2  |\n      |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n\n* _\"In synthetic experiments can the authors show the number/magnitude of the coefficients that where clipped?\"_\n\n    In one synthetic experiment with $N^{2}=16$, we have observed $8$ negative values in $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ that were eventually removed by clipping. In another similar experimental setup with $N^{2}=81$, we have observed $43$ negative values in $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ before clipping.\n\n\n* _\"Why negative definite covariance matrices cannot be considered in GPs as to explain why a clipping has to be introduced?\"_\n\n    For GPs, there is a strong requirement that the covariance matrix is positive definite as it needs to generate positive definite covariances. Ayhan _et al._ (2012) have discussed in detail the issues of using indefinite kernels in GPs. Therefore, we need ways to enforce positive definiteness before we compute predictive variances. In contrast, for SVMs it is possible to use indefinite (Kre\u012dn) kernels (Alabdulmohsin _et al._ 2015).\n\n\n**Reviewer suggested additional experiments:**\n\nWe have conducted few new experiments, but unfortunately we will not be able to show any graph in the current NeurIPS review system. However, we will try to convey the results in the best possible way.\n\n* _\"Can the authors repeat the synthetic experiments when normalizing the curves to have zero mean?\"_\n\n    As suggested, we have repeated our synthetic experiment to transform our objective function to have zero mean. The new experimental results of our Squared Exponential (SE) kernel revealed that in the held-out test region the GP predicted mean does not go downwards as in the previous case, instead, it tries to fall back to the $y=0$ line from both the sides of X-axis, which is the prior mean. The maximum log-likelihood obtained for all the kernels considered in this experiment is listed in Table 2. The SE kernel still performed\npoorly compared to other kernels.\n\n\n**Table 2**: The maximum log-likelihood (along with its standard deviation) for the synthetic function (higher the better). \n\n      |        Kernel      |       SE     |       MKL     |       MAT     |        KFO      |\n      |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n      |    Log-likelihood  |  \u2212900 \u00b1 2.24 | 92.468 \u00b1 0.82 | 91.108 \u00b1 0.54 | 109.431 \u00b1 0.026 |  \n      |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n\n* _\"If the x-axis was centered to zero, then the weight assigned to the linear kernel will be close to null?\"_\n\n    We have conducted this new experiment by modifying our objective function to vary between ($-X_{\\text{max}}$, $X_{\\text{max}}$) such that the objective function is centered on the Origin ($0,0$). The skewness induced in the confidence intervals (an increasing trend in the $\\pm2\\sigma$) of our previous Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) posteriors no longer appear in the new experimental results. We further observed that out of all the kernels chosen in MKL, the least weight was assigned to the Linear kernel ($k_{\\text{LIN}}$) _i.e.,_ $w_{3}=0.114$ compared to the other weights of $[w_{1,}w_{2}]=[0.478,0.961]$. \n\n\nBoth the above-mentioned experiments were merged into one single experiment to measure the maximum log-likelihood for all the kernels considered. The corresponding results are listed in Table 2.\n\n\n* _\"Plotting and comparing the optimised Mat\u00e9rn 3/2 kernel and KFO tuned kernel. Can KFO recover translation-invariant data?'\"_\n\n    In this experiment, we aim at understanding the characteristics of the kernel tuned with Kernel Functional Optimisation (KFO) procedure $k_{KFO}$ and Mat\u00e9rn\nkernel ($k_{MAT}$) by plotting both the kernels. The results looked visually similar ($3D$ plots). To obtain a numerical comparison\nwe have sampled a set of points for the kernel inputs $\\mathbf{x_1}$ and $\\mathbf{x_{2}}$ and computed their $L_{\\infty}$ norm. Based\non $500$ number of points we estimate the $L_{\\infty}$ to be $0.185$, which is rather small. Furthermore, the visual ($3D$ plot) of the\n$k_{\\text{KFO}}$ kernel revealed the translation-invariant features (apparent translation invariance along the line $x=y$, reflection\nsymmetry on the line $x=-y$).\n\n\n* _\"Would KFO procedure be able to recover the kernel of a dataset that would be generated with zero mean and some kernel $k(x,x')$?\"_\n\n    We have conducted another set of experiments to demonstrate the kernel recovery by KFO. In this experiment, we try to recover a non-stationary linear kernel. We have considered a synthetic function - linear function $y=0.5x$, and generated $20$ evenly spaced observations in the interval $[-1,1]$. Then, we fit a ground truth GP ($GP_{GT}$) on those observations using a ground truth kernel ($k_{GT}$) - a linear kernel in this case, and then we tune the hyperparameters of $k_{GT}$ by maximising the log-likelihood. Now, we use the same set of observations in the GP ($GP_{KFO}$) fitted by our KFO algorithm and run the optimisation procedure to find the optimal kernel. We visually confirmed that the posterior distribution of $GP_{KFO}$ is identical to that of $GP_{GT}$. Further, we have computed the predictive log-likelihood ($PL$) over $500$ number of points sampled from a much bigger range of $[-10,10]$ for both the GPs and they turned out to be very close as (i) $PL_{KFO}$= $2449.045$ (ii) $PL_{GT}$= $2045.148$, showing that the kernels are also very close.\n\n\n* _\"Would there be techniques to sample the kernels exclusively in the cone of positive definite kernels?\"_\n\n    This is an interesting question that we have pondered before. One possible way to ensure that the kernel remains positive is by constructing the kernel samples $\\mathbf{k}$ (Eq. (5) of the main paper) by sampling strictly positive $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(\\cdot)}$. Then, we apply a linear transformation on $\\mathbf{k}$ to ensure its positive definiteness. Further, we restrict the kernel weights to be strictly positive (Eq. (4) of the main paper). We believe that such constraints result in a highly restricted search space, not covering the full cone of positive definite kernels. The optimisation on such an overly restricted search space results in sub-optimal solutions, which may not be acceptable. Unfortunately, we are unable to construct any different method that can restrict sampling in the cone of positive definite kernels.\n\n**_Minor comments addressed:_**\n* _Line 119 : \"do the authors only intend to give examples of the type of indefinite kernels contained in_ $\\mathcal{H}_{\\kappa}$ _?\"_\n   \n\n    We initially intended to discuss only the decomposition with respect to indefinite kernels, but it is a decent idea to quote Lemma 7 of\nOng _et al._ (2005) to complement to what we are trying to state.\n\n\n* _Line 209_ : In _Line 196-208_, we have provided an approach to transform the kernel matrix by applying a linear transformation\nat the Gram matrix level. Though this approach works for SVMs, it may get inadequate for GPs. GPs require the calculation of predictive\nmean $\\mu(\\cdot)$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}(\\cdot)$ for the test samples. It is almost surely impossible to consistently transform the kernel matrix to ensure a positive predictive variance. Therefore, as an alternative way to ensure positive definiteness in GPs, we clip $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=[{(\\alpha_i)}_{+}]$ mentioned in Eq. (4) of the main paper. \n\n* _Line 319_: In Table 1 of the main paper, the column marked by $\\dagger$ corresponds to the accuracy results obtained by state-of-the-art classifiers listed in Zhang et al. (2017). We have just reported the results from other classifiers present in the literature to emphasise the margin of improvement achieved with our proposed approach. The details are discussed in _Line 286-292_.\n\n\n**References**\n\n* C. S. Ong, A. J. Smola, and R. C. Williamson. Learning the kernel with hyperkernels.

    "comment": "We thank our reviewer's time and effort invested in understanding the paper to raise some interesting points. Please see\nbelow our replies to the key points raised.\n\n\n* _\"Parameter selection is not clear (n, T, S)\"_\n   * $n$ is the dimensionality of the underlying classification or regression problem and is classification/regression problem-specific.\n   \n\n   * $T$, $S$ are the parameters of our Kernel Functional Optimisation (KFO) method, where $S$ is the number of subspace searches and $T$ is the number of iterations in each of the subspaces. \n\n    In this work, we have considered a fixed computational budget ($S\\times T$) for the optimisation and set $S=5$ and $T=20$. If we are not concerned with the computational budget, we can set up stopping criteria (following Kirschner _et al._ (2019)) based on the quality of the solution achieved _i.e.,_ the terminating condition is set with a measure such as simple regret or cumulative regret to keep track of the optimisation performance. We have discussed the convergence guarantees of our approach for both the criteria (fixed and variable $T$) in _Theoretical Analysis_ section (section _4.3_) \n\n\n* _\"How would parameter selection work for datasets like ImageNet?\"_\n\n    The main bottleneck of our proposed approach is the computation of the covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{g}\\times N_{g}}$, where $N_{g}$ corresponds to the number of points in the grid (Note: for notational convenience we use $N_g$ for the grid size). The computational complexity of performing Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to identify $N'\\ll N_{g}^{2}$ principal components of $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$ is $\\mathcal{O}(N'N_{g}^{2})$. Following our same recipe on ImageNet dataset with $n=1024$, we can choose the grid size $N_{g}=10\\times1024=10240$ to compute the covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$, which is feasible on HPC infrastructure, and then reduce the complexity to a more reasonable $N'\\ll N_{g}^{2}$ prior to entering the main optimisation loop. The main Bayesian optimisation loop in our proposed approach is not tightly coupled with $n$ and remains unaffected by the computation and PCA decomposition of the covariance matrices. Thus we may still be able to run KFO on this dataset, although we may be approaching the limit of feasibility. However, on a more practical note, kernel algorithms excel in small to middle-sized problems and KFO should be easily applicable in such scenarios.\n\n\n* _\"If the proposed technique also works for large scale100s of category's classification\"_\n\n    The number of categories or the target classes in the given problem does not play a role in determining the optimisation performance.\nRather, this is determined by the complexity of the kernel search space, which may or may not be coupled to such factors.\n\n\n* _Dataset specific peculiarities of KFO_\n\n    We ideally expect our proposed method KFO to at least achieve the performance of any standard parametric kernel. However, it is observed from our empirical results that sometimes our approach is not able to find the optimum kernel, the possible reason could be the insufficient computational budget allocated or the numerical approximations. \n\n\n* _Model/data bias_\n\n    Since we use a universal hyperkernel for constructing the space of kernel functionals on which we perform optimisation, there is no bias\ninduced into our models. Data bias and explainability are outside the scope of our paper.\n\n\n**References**\n\n* J. Kirschner, M. Mutny, N. Hiller, R. Ischebeck, and A. Krause.

Please see below our replies to the key points raised.\n* _\"This paper involves a lot of basic knowledge. The author should give more detailed introduction\"_\n\n    In the current version of our paper, we tried our best to provide all the necessary background given the space constraints. But, we\nwill try to rewrite few sections to create some free space and incorporate the given feedback. \n\n\n* _\"GP-UCB? To increase the readability, the author should give some necessary descriptions in the main paper\"_\n\n   In _Line 76_, the acronym GP-UCB stands for Gaussian Process - Upper Confidence Bound, one of the popular acquisition functions\ncommonly used in the context of Bayesian optimisation. We have briefly discussed in _Background_ section, as well as in the supplementary material (section _A.1.1_). A detailed explanation of GP-UCB and its theoretical guarantees are provided in Srinivas _et\nal._ (2012) and Brochu _et al._ (2010). \n\n\n* _\"Explain how PCA can reduce the complexity?\"_\n\n    In _Line 157-159_, we perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to avoid the computational burden resulting from the large covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{{N_g}\\times{N_g}}$ for the given grid size $N_{g}$ (Note: for notational convenience we use $N_g$ for the grid size). Here, we do not perform a full PCA, rather we choose only top $N'$ principal components ($N'\\ll N_{g}$). The computational complexity of finding top $N'$ principal components is $\\mathcal{O}(N'N_{g}^{2})$, which is much lower than $\\mathcal{O}(N_{g}^{3})$. Moreover, we perform PCA only once, prior to entering the outer and inner optimisation loops. Thus we incur a cost on startup but are rewarded with significant computational savings in the main optimisation loop where the computational burden is proportional to $N'$ rather than $N_{g}^{2}$.\n\n**References**\n* E.

    "comment": "We appreciate your time and effort to provide a thoughtful review. Please see below our replies to the key points raised.\n* _Comparison with \"Bayesian optimization for automated model selection\"_\n\n   We thank you for the reference of Malkomes _et al._ (2016). We will add this in our related work section. However, as pointed out by you, our work is fundamentally different - our method can obtain the best non-parametric kernel, whereas the design space for Malkomes\n_et al._ (2016) is limited in the compositional space of parametric forms. In short, Kernel Functional Optimisation (KFO) designed kernel\nshould supersede any kernels found by them.\n\n\n* _Selection of $N^{2}$ points for representing the hyperkernel_\n\n   The number of points $N^{2}$ in the grid $\\mathcal{G}$ is an important parameter. A very fine resolution grid ensures that we can capture small-scale patterns in the kernel. However, a large grid size comes with large computational cost. As a trade-off we set the grid size _i.e.,_ $N^{2}\\geq10\\times n$, and we find that this works in practice (specifically, (a) it outperforms the baselines in majority\nof the datasets, and (b) we observe that increasing $N^{2}$ further does not give significant improvements in performance). Also, to improve clarity we will replace the notation $N^{2}$ by $N_{g}$ in the updated version. \n\n\n* _Discussion of the computational/memory demands of the method and its efficacy w.r.t. size of the data_\n\n    The computational complexity of our approach is in the order of $\\mathcal{O}(STN_{g}^{3})$, where $S$ is the number of subspace searches, $T$ is the number of iterations in each subspace and $N_{g}$ is the number of points in the grid, not including the complexity of the downstream class (as it would be different for different kernel machines). The memory complexity is in the order of $\\mathcal{O}(N_{g}^{2})$. The percentage of time spent optimising (searching) the kernel ($4^{th}$ column in the table) and the percentage of time spent evaluating the kernel ($5^{th}$ column in the table) by our proposed approach is shown in the table below. We can see that the percentage of time spent in optimising the kernel is no more than $10\\\\%$ of the whole model fitting time. Hence, the proposed\nKFO does not add much overhead to the model fitting process. We have also provided the total runtime (in seconds) required for an instance of KFO tuned SVM to complete $S\\times T$ iterations, where $S=T=5$. The total runtime also includes the runtime required for generating $4$ random observations in each subspace. The wall clock times for our experiments are measured on a server with Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor, having 16 GB of RAM.  \n\n**Table**: Runtimes measured for SVM tuned with KFO kernel\n\n      | Dataset | Instances | Features |  Search Time(%) |  Evaluation Time(%) |  Total Runtime  |\n      |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n      | Sonar   |    208    |    60    |      9\u00b10.30     |     90.87\u00b10.69      |   567.85\u00b14.64   |\n      | Heart   |    303    |    13    |    4.7\u00b10.35     |     95.24\u00b10.56      |  1070.03\u00b124.12  |\n      | Glass   |    214    |    9     |   9.35\u00b10.55     | \t90.64\u00b10.44      |   554.73\u00b18.19   |\n      | Credit  |    1000   |    24    |   0.90\u00b10.13     |     98.84\u00b10.36      |  5191.36\u00b142.38  |  \n      |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n\n\n**References**\n* G.

    "comment": "\nWe thank the reviewer for their comments and time, and agree with all points we\ndo not explicitly mention.  Here are our main responses.\n\n1. **Presentation of Theorem 1.1.** We agree that it is hard to interpret the\n   statement, and even to ensure that terms really can all be mutually\n   controlled.  We have considered making Theorem 1.1 an abstract lemma\n   and leaving it in the appendix, and instead having two separate theorems\n   (corollaries) in the body:\n   a \"worst case\" theorem where we fix many terms like $\\rho$ and explicitly\n   compute $\\tau_0$, $\\tau_1$, and get a bound which clearly goes to $0$ with\n   $m$ and $n$ for arbitrary data, and a separate \"nice data\" theorem where\n   instead we assume a nice condition on $\\overline{U}_\\infty$ and obtain\n   a clean, interpretable faster rate.\n   We could also move much of the words/presentation of Theorem 1.1 into the\n   introduction and related discussion. \n   We are eager to hear more feedback from the reviewer on this approach.\n\n1. **Journal or conference?** As the main prior and relevant work appears in conferences,\n  we feel NeurIPS is the ideal venue.  We will work to improve the presentation\n  as the reviewer suggests.\n\n1. **Issues with the relationship between early-stopping and interpolation.**\n  We agree that our our discussion here was inadequate and will expand the body;\n  briefly, here are a few comments which reflect our understanding, and we\n  are eager to hear more comments from the reviewer!\n\n    First, two technical points:\n\n    - Early stopping refers to the selection of $t$, namely the maximum iteration\n      considered by the argmin within $W_{\\leq t}$.  As in, while $W_{\\leq t}$ is chosen\n      via training error, we only consider iterations up to some $t$, and we can not\n      let this $t$ be too large in general.\n\n    - Secondly, as we discuss in the general comment above, we had an oversight in\n      Theorem 1.1, we need to replace $R$ in a few places in the statement \n      with $R + \\sqrt{ t \\cdot \\mathcal{R}(\\overline{U}_\\infty)}$.  In particular,\n      this means the generalization part of the full bound has a\n      term $\\sqrt{ t \\cdot \\mathcal{R}(\\overline{U}_\\infty) / n}$, which explicitly\n      requires early stopping whenever $\\mathcal{R}(\\overline{U}_\\infty)$ is not close to\n      zero in order to ensure $t/n = o(1)$.  As is discussed there, after this fix we still have our \"data simplicity\" story, and also we can still control all terms and establish our consistency corollary.\n\n    With these technical points out of the way, we summarize the early-stopping situation\n    as follows.  In the general case, we will need $t=o(n)$, and may fail to interpolate;\n    this is certainly necessary to control all terms in our upper bound (Theorem 1.1), but\n    we don't fully prove it is necessary (our Proposition 1.2 is specialized, as many reviewers\n    point out).\n\n    We are eager to discuss further, and look forward to any other comments by the reviewer!\n",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their comments and time, and agree with all points we\ndo not explicitly mention.  Here are our main responses.\n\n1. **Unusual layout.** We agree that the paper can be more direct presenting\n   its key statements, contributions, and comparison to prior work.  We tried\n   for a \"relaxed\" presentation and agree it was sometimes \"tentative\", as the\n   reviewer says.  One aspect we wish to improve, which the reviewer did not\n   mention, is better highlighting the new elements in the proof summary, e.g.,\n   the explicit new linearization technique and its key proof aspects.  (We\n   highlighted some of these contributions in our response to reviewer afNw.)\n\n1. **Comparison to works using weights near initialization.**\n   We are not sure we follow this question, since our proofs also stay near\n   initialization, but here is our best understanding and we urge the reviewer\n   to follow up.\n\n   Firstly, we also stay near initialization.  However, we may even stop much\n   earlier.  As a concrete example, suppose the data has some regularity (e.g.,\n   we never sample the same data point twice with opposite labels), and\n   consider a very large width.\n   Then we can consider a standard NTK analysis, e.g., by Allen-Zhu/Li/Song,\n   and achieve training error zero.  The test error after such an analysis will\n   be unclear, however.  Meanwhile our proof technique will suggest stopping earlier,\n   possibly with non-zero training error, and achieve a good test error.\n\n   This point is quite delicate and we are eager to discuss it further!\n\n1. **Confusing discussion of early-stopping.**\n  We agree we need to expand our discussion here; we even considered including a figure with the\n  gradient descent path and different regimes (e.g., including feature learning), and are open\n  to further comments.  In more detail, our thoughts are as follows.\n\n    Firstly, we feel some of the confusion is due to a term we neglected to include in Theorem 1.1.\n    We detail this term in the general remark above, but as a brief summary, the correction\n    is to replace $R$ with $R + \\sqrt{ t \\cdot \\mathcal{R}(\\overline{U}_\\infty)}$ in a few places.\n    This term can be interpreted as \"either a good test error is possible, or our optimization radius\n    can blow up as $\\sqrt{t}$\".  (We detail the fix to the proof above, but it is very easy,\n    just some brief algebra inside one existing lemma and no new machinery.)\n    Once this term is corrected, then Theorem 1.1 has an explicit\n    $\\sqrt{ t \\cdot \\mathcal{R}(\\overline{U}_\\infty) / n}$ term, which means we must require $t = o(n)$\n    whenever $\\mathcal{R}(\\overline{U}_\\infty)$ is not small.\n    As such, the bound still achieves our goals: it still reflects data simplicity, and still all terms can be controlled to prove consistency as a corollary (more details are in the general comment).\n    Does this correction clarify the picture?\n\n    Overall, we summarize our understanding of early stopping as follows.\n    Our upper bound proof technique, with the correction, requires early stoppping;\n    it also requires weights to stay near initialization, but in fact we might\n    stop much earlier than other analyses near initialization, and not achieve\n    zero training error, but on the other hand we achieve good test error.\n    Our lower bound technique, meanwhile, is far from establishing the necessity\n    of early stopping; we will discuss this gap, as it is a valuable direction\n    for future work.\n\n    We will gladly include these points in our revisions, and are eager for further comments\n    from the reviewer!\n\n\n1. **Missing citations.**\n   We thank the reviewer very much for mentioning these\n   very interesting works. We'll revise the related work to discuss their\n   relationship to our paper.\n   \"Quadratic suffices [...]\" in particular is very relevant to our interest in\n   handling the smallest possible widths.\n   Thank you again!\n\n",

    "comment": "\nWe thank the reviewer for their comments and time, and agree with all points we\ndo not explicitly mention.  Here are our main responses.\n\n1. **Unclear if relevant to practical success of deep networks.**\n   Overall we agree with this point, and will expand our \"open problem\" section to further\n   close this gap, and include comments in the body.\n   Regarding $k$-nn, we mention one interesting point, that convergence rates\n   for $k$-nn are non-parametric (to our knowledge), whereas our rate here is\n   a parametric $1/\\sqrt{n}$ rate, as with boosting methods; we feel this deserves\n   further study.\n   Relatedly, while it is true that our work can be viewed as a sanity check,\n   we had no idea if it was possible before completing all proofs.\n   As an example, our proofs can handle arbitrarily large widths (Theorem 1.1\n   only places lower bounds on width), whereas most generalization bounds blow\n   up with large width, something we sidestep in this general setting\n   via our \"delinearization\" technique as detailed to reviewer afNw.\n\n1. **Data simplicity not a major contribution.**\n  While our characterization can be improved, we do not know of a general\n  analysis that handles data simplicity.  E.g., while the infinite-width\n  simplicity notion appeared in the prior work of Ji & Telgarsky, they require\n  margins, and their proof technique can not handle data with negative\n  margins as we require here.\n  A similar data simplicity notion was considered in the follow-up\n  work we cite by Chen et al., which moreover can handle some small amount of\n  margin violations, however firstly they do not use infinite-width\n  reference networks, and secondly their test error has a multiplicative\n  constant which means they can not achieve optimal test error. As detailed to\n  reviewer afNW, our simplicity notion is sufficient to imply some non-vacuous\n  bounds, and thus we feel it is promising.\n\n1. **Citing Nakkiran & Bansal.**  We agree this is very relevant, and apologize\n   for the omission!  Concretely, the experiments with noise can be included\n   both in the related work where we mention works of Bai et al., which\n   theoretically analyze noise, and perhaps we can also incorporate the\n   citation earlier in the body for motivation.  We can also mention the \n   relationship with Proposition 1.2, though it is a bit delicate, as the\n   settings and proof techniques differ.\n\n",

Thus, the strong convergence results established in this work are rather interesting.

    "comment": "\nWe thank the reviewer for their comments and time, and agree with all points we\ndo not explicitly mention.  Here are our main responses.\n\n1. **Large parts of the analysis seem rather incremental.**  While we did rely on a number of\n  existing tools, we have a number of new components which are central to our story.  We will\n  adjust our body, in particular the proof sketch, to better highlight the new contributions, but\n  here is a brief summary.\n\n    - In section 2.1 we mentioned a \"co-VC dimension\" technique.  Concretely, this is item 2 of Lemma A.5,\n      but most of the heavy lifting is in Lemma A.4.  Lemma A.4 is nontrivial and not based on any argument\n      we know in the literature, and is the main technical advance over prior work.  This Lemma\n      in turn powers many of other key steps in the proof, and we do not know how to perform these steps\n      without it:\n\n        1. We mentioned that generalization proceeds via linearization and\n           \"de-linearization\".  This second step is over the distribution, not just\n           a finite sample, and makes crucial use of de-linearization over the\n           entire sphere. We only know how to do this using the aforementioned\n           Lemma A.5, and not anything from prior work.\n\n        1. When we sample the infinite width model $\\overline{U}_\\infty$ to produce a good finite-width\n          reference network, we again need to control the error over the whole sphere, and use Lemma A.5.\n          Prior work provides no alternative; e.g., while the work of Ji & Telgarsky also samples infinite-width\n          networks, there they have a margin, and it suffices to do an elementary sampling analysis\n          which only considers a finite training set.\n\n    - As minor technical contributions which are not direct from prior work: (a) the multiplicative property\n      of the logistic loss, as in Lemma 2.1, and in particular the consequence that the optimization analysis can be\n      carried through invoking only these multiplicative errors; (b) the idea to linearize and de-linearize\n      for generalization has not appeared before.\n\n1. **The analysis of early-stoping [...] cannot be regarded as conclusive.** We\n   agree; e.g., we only showed early-stopping is sufficient, but we only\n   suggested (via Proposition 1.2) that it is necessary, and did not fully\n   establish necessity. We will add this explicitly as an open problem in\n   Section 4, and expand our discussion in the rest of the body.\n\n1. **Interpolation and double descent.**  We agree, though we remark that the\n   discussion will be delicate, since the main works in that literature\n   optimize the squared loss, and often work with specialized data.  E.g.,\n   double descent usually has its \"peak\" when $m=n$ (our width $m$ corresponds\n   to the dimension there), whereas here we have situations where we can\n   interpolate with $m = \\text{polylog}(n)$.  And for example, with\n   interpolation, as in our Proposition 1.2, often we will early stop far\n   before interpolation occurs.  If the reviewer would like to suggest\n   a concrete investigation, we would be happy to follow it.  E.g., we could\n   take the precise setting of standard double descent (e.g., Gaussian data,\n   and the noise model), and point out where different choices in our theorem\n   (e.g., $m$) fall on the curve.\n\n1. **Choices for second layer weights.** Basically anything with similar\n   statistics to our choice will be fine; e.g., deterministically alternating\n   $\\pm 1$ signs, or using Gaussians.\n\n1. **Estimating magic quantities, in particular for mnist and cifar.**\n  The key magic object in our eyes (please correct us if there was another quantity) is\n  $\\overline{U}_\\infty$, its norm $R$, and its population risk $\\mathcal{R}(\\overline{U}_\\infty)$.\n  This quantity can in fact be estimated, as we detail in our general response above, but here\n  we will provide a brief summary.  We can train a *finite-width* NTK of a similar form to\n  $\\overline{U}_\\infty$, and prove that its norm and test error are reflective of a related\n  infinite-width model, thus estimating the missing quantities.  Two key questions and their\n  resolution is as follows.\n\n    - **Does this match our story, at least on mnist or cifar?**  We ran the preceding experiment\n      (as detailed above) on mnist 1 vs 5 and 3 vs 5, and found that the complexity estimates\n      were much better (lower) for 1 vs 5, an intuitively easier prediction problem.\n      Therefore these experiments are consistent with our story.  As detailed above, we did\n      not try hard to optimize these numbers, and feel they can be made even more compelling.\n\n    - **Are the estimates non-vacuous?** We will discuss this in more detail in a separate point,\n      but briefly, the flexibility of Theorem 1.1 is we can effectively *enforce* non-vacuity\n      as follows.  As in the experiment we conducted, and noting that the key complexity term\n      related to $n$ in Theorem 1.1 is $R/\\sqrt{n}$, we can consider models where $R = o(\\sqrt{n})$.\n      We were still able to obtain meaningful bounds (i.e., subject to this constraint,\n      we were still able to achieve good test error).\n\n    As a brief remark, regarding cifar, since generally it requires a multi-layer and/or\n    convolutional structure for good performance, we did not check how it behaved, but \n    are open to input on this point, especially since mnist is \"easy\".\n\n    We were very fascinated by these experiments and certainly would like to include\n    a more elaborate version in the paper, and are eager for further comments!\n\n1. **Comparison to existing generalization bounds.**\n  We thank the reviewer for mentioning the work on \"non-vacuous generalization\n  bounds\".  Continuing with the previous point, we feel that we did provide non-vacuous\n  bounds, though the situation is a bit delicate, as in the following two points.\n\n    - Firstly, the relationship to existing generalization bounds is delicate.\n      On the one hand, the linearization/de-linearization generalization\n      technique here saves a factor at least $\\sqrt{m}$ over the standard\n      Rademacher bounds (say, Bartlett et al. and Golowich et al.). However, the\n      present bound only holds for activation patterns close to the initial one,\n      whereas those others are more general.  To summarize, while on the positive side\n      our generalization bound technique seems to omit extra factors which rendered\n      many previous bounds \"non-vacuous\", we can not compare them apples-to-oranges\n      since ours only applies to a very restricted subclass of networks which \n      is specialized to our analysis.\n\n    - Secondly, to assert \"non-vacuity\", we still need to estimate all the magic\n      quantities. As in the experiment above, we chose parameters to ensure we\n      are in the ballpark for a non-vacuous claim: specifically, $R/\\sqrt{n} < 1$\n      and $\\mathcal{R}(\\overline{U}_\\infty)\\ll 1$.

    "comment": "Dear reviewer,\n\nthank you a lot for your time. Please find our answers to your remarks below:\n\n> However, there should be more comparisons to competing methods. For instance in section 6.3, there is no clear comparison to training without force matching.\n\nThis is a very good idea. In fact, a comparison of different training approaches is presented in Sec. 6.4 but the results are not visualized. We agree that a visualization of the forces and energies obtained from training without force matching would be helpful and we will happily incorporate these plots in the final version.\n\n> They mention a competing method, i.e. stochastic normalizing flows, but they only refer to the article and do not show the results when stochastic normalizing flows are applied to the same problem.\n\nReviewer QQCj asked a very similar question. We will copy our answer here:\n\n\u201cSNFs won\u2019t work with force matching and don\u2019t provide tractable model energy. Running several MD steps between each flow layer also adds tremendously to the computational complexity of the method. Furthermore, they provide an orthogonal contribution that can easily be combined with smooth flows. In the SNF paper, they are used together with affine coupling layers and NSF couplings. So combining them with our smooth flow couplings would be straightforward, yet not providing new insight in this context..\u201d\n\nAs suggested by Reviewer q1W2 we will add some comparing figures for Sec. 5.\n\n> Although the authors are focused on approximating Boltzmann distributions, their framework is in theory not limited to this setting so it would be interesting to see how well other densities could be approximated.\n\nSmooth flows introduce a specific inductive bias for domains where smoothness is relevant. Beyond the physical examples, as discussed, we are currently not aware of very different problems where higher-order of smoothness is critical for success. In classic density estimation problems, this inductive bias might not be necessary or even harmful (e.g. if the data distribution is non-smooth). \n",

[...] Extra experiments would be great to have but no necessary I believe, but it's worth some discussion on why flows are the right choice of generative models in the beginning.\n\nWhile pure density estimation would be possible with EBMs and similar models (e.g. like the model referred to by you) our task slightly differs as we already know the target energy (up to its normalizing constant). Thus an EBM-like model will likely not give us more information than we already have. In addition, sampling from such an EBM-like model (if trained to proper accuracy) would be as hard as sampling from the original Boltzmann distribution.\n\nOther generative models, such as latent variable models (e.g. VAEs) could be used as well for density estimation together with variational inference as we do in this work. The referenced stochastic normalizing flow [43] would be such a model. However, due to the intractability of the model energy (and forces) certain applications, such as molecular dynamics simulations of the learned model, would not be possible. As explained in answers to the other reviewers, it would easily be possible to combine the proposed smooth flows with such latent variable models, yet we do not think that adding such a comparison would contribute meaningfully to the questions of this work.\n\nWe will try our best to explain this more clearly in the final manuscript and motivate why flows are filling a sweet spot here.",

Regarding your remarks, please see our answers below:\n\n> Am I correct in understanding that the primary difference is in the proposed transformation being restricted to some interval [a, b] (e.g. $[0, 1]$), while also being well-behaved/smooth at the boundaries of that interval?\n\nYes.

Given that the method authors propose is also \"non-analytic\", at least in terms of its inverse, I wonder if these references would be worth investigating, especially given their desirable smoothness properties?\n\nReference [6] has a non-analytic forward evaluation that requires approximation techniques (e.g. black box ODE solvers). This can lead to inexact solutions and integration problems, e.g. if the target density is very stiff (as is usually the case for molecular potentials). Another downside of such continuous flow models is the cost of evaluating the Jacobian. Evaluating the exact Jacobian becomes quickly intractable with the dimensionality of the system, whereas noisy estimations, e.g. as done with the Hutchinson estimator, show poor performance in the energy-based training setup and would not provide correct forces. Beyond that, optimizing nODE can become a challenge, as the adjoint method for computing the gradients requires solving an ODE by itself and thus can become numerically difficult. In order to smoothly lift neural ODEs to the circle, recent approaches to nODEs on manifold could be leveraged (see cited references), yet adding another level of complexity. \n\nReference [41] requires numerical integration of a positive function using some quadrature scheme. This implies a similar problem as mentioned for nODEs: stiff target distribution, such as molecular systems, require high precision and thus many evaluation points. This quickly leads to runtime or memory bottlenecks (depending on implementation). While the inverse of our suggested smooth flows is also obtained with a black-box evaluation method, please consider that forward evaluation is fast and exact. In the case of Ref. [41] each forward evaluation that happens during inversion is again based on numerical integration.\n\nIn order to explain the mismatch to the results as obtained on large, high-dimensional datasets: we believe that there can be a difference, whether such models are used for pure density estimation on data, or for approximating a very stiff ground-truth energy as it is in our case. Usually, flows on images are solely evaluated by comparing the negative log-likelihood on holdout data. For our molecular systems this by itself might not help a lot: e.g. bending some torsion angles wrongly might have a minor effect on the likelihood of a sample, yet if it leads to overlapping atoms instantly leads to singular energies. As such, we think that such typical density estimation might have more forgiving characteristics during which these numerical difficulties might not matter as much as we experienced them.\n\nWe will write this part more clearly in the final manuscript.\n\n> The convex combination of the forward and the inverse KL divergences in eq. (5) reminds me of the \u03b1-divergence: could this be a more principled way to express the desired \"distance\"?\n\nWe chose to use (and modify regarding the force matching error) the original loss taken from Ref. [30] for consistency reasons. As far as we see it, it is not expressable as an alpha-divergence. However, we think looking into alpha-divergences could be a very interesting idea to investigate in future work. At first sight, we do not fully know how to cope with the unknown normalizing constant of the target distribution in this context. We will look into this! Thanks for the hint.",

    "comment": "Dear reviewer,\n\nwe thank you kindly for your time. Please find our answers to your concerns and remarks below:\n\n> The computational cost and scalability would be critical concerns.\n\nWe discuss the computational cost of our smooth transformations in the Supplementary Information (Table SI-1) by comparing the non-analytic inversion to the efficient analytic inversion of neural spline flows (NSF). NSFs are known to be computationally cheap compared to most other normalizing flow architectures. The cost of our forward evaluation is comparable to that of neural spline flows. As expected, the non-analytic inversion using standard bijection is more than one order of magnitude slower in both the forward and backward pass. However, by using the proposed multi-bin bijection, the computational cost can be significantly lowered to within a factor of 2-3 of neural spline flows. This relatively minor overhead is easily justified in applications that benefit from the smoothness of the transformations in other ways.\n\nRegarding scalability: the inversion entails only one-dimensional root-finding problems (one for each element of the transformed tensors). Thus, the computational complexity scales linearly in the problem dimension (not considering caching and vectorization effects).\n\n> Since the paper aims to solve challenging problems in physical systems, the toy examples or synthesis datasets are not very meaningful\n\nWhile alanine dipeptide might be considered a toy example in the context of MD, sampling from its conformational distribution is a challenging task for generative networks. In contrast to the most common generative tasks in computer vision, sampling in physics usually requires a quantitative match of the models\u2019 energies and forces. Even small random perturbations of the atom positions can perturb these energies dramatically, see for instance Fig. 7 and surrounding discussion in our Reference [23]. Due to this highly sensitive, 66-dimensional potential energy surface, a quantitative match with the target distribution is not easily obtained by generative networks. We are not aware of any studies that obtain a similar degree of precision as presented in Fig. 3 when using a neural network for small-molecule conformational sampling.\n\n> The used example in this paper might not be a large-scale example so I can not clearly see the performance in real-world applications.\n\nWhile applying our smooth flows to larger molecules is a work in progress, the conformational sampling of small molecules is in itself an important scientific problem in many areas, including drug development and chemical engineering. The presented example is a state-of-the-art benchmark and has been used to test neural sampling methods in previous work, see our References. \n\nWhile running similar experiments on large common benchmark systems like Chignolin or BPTI could be done in principle (here we would refer to Ref. [30]) it would not show anything additional insight relevant for proving our point: that smooth flows are beneficial when trying to match physical potentials. \n\nRunning similar tests for such systems is straightforward from a scientific perspective (in the end we would even barely need to change our model), yet it constitutes a significant engineering effort while not providing many new scientific insights for the ML community. It would be an interesting result for scientists from the domain, yet we believe it would be beyond the scope of interests for a broader ML audience.\n\n> Due to physical motivation, I am not sure how to apply the proposed methods for general problems in the ML community, for example, image datasets\n\nThe studied problem lies at the core of many problems in molecular physics and is a crucial part of understanding the behavior of proteins and materials. \n\nAlso, consider that a method like AlphaFold is inapplicable to image problems, yet clearly constitutes a major contribution to the ML community. On the other hand, innovations in generative models that improve image sampling quality e.g. by introducing useful inductive biases, will likely not benefit molecular sampling. \n\nWe see our paper as a meaningful methodological contribution to deriving better inductive biases for flows when applied to the named physical problems. As such, we see it clearly as a machine learning paper that fits the NeurIPS call for papers as \u201can interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers in machine learning, computational neuroscience, statistics, optimization, economics, computer vision, natural language processing, computational biology, and other fields\u201d where applications and domain-related work is explicitly encouraged in the call-for-papers.\n\n> For the baseline methods, have you compared with stochastic NFs [1]? \n\nSNFs won\u2019t work with force matching and don\u2019t provide tractable model energies. Running several MD steps between each flow layer also adds tremendously to the computational complexity of the method. Furthermore, they provide an orthogonal contribution that can easily be combined with smooth flows. In the SNF paper, they are used together with affine coupling layers and NSF couplings. So combining them with our smooth flow couplings would be straightforward, yet not providing new insight in this context.\n\n> Right now, only compared with NSF may not be strong enough to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed smooth NFs.\n\nWe tried our best to discuss possible alternatives in Sec. 2 and 4 and why we believe they are not suitable in the given situation, e.g. because they are unable to satisfy all requirements simultaneously, or are only able to do that without the unbearable computational overhead and numerical approximation issues (e.g. if pointwise neural ODEs with manifold constraints are used within coupling layers).

    "comment": "We are encouraged that the reviewer found our experiments compelling and the theory insightful. We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s detailed comments, baseline and experimental suggestions, and overall expertise on continuous-time (CT) networks, which has helped improve the context of our work. We provide some general comments about the theoretical and empirical contributions of our paper, and then respond in detail to the reviewer\u2019s technical comments and experimental suggestions.\n\n### Conceptual Contributions\n\nThe reviewer\u2019s primary concern is the novelty around the CT to RNN connection. While our method is certainly related to previous CT/RNN works, it is clearly distinguished in many ways. Compared to conventional CT/RNN methods, it is:\n- based on a different underlying ODE,\n- orders of magnitude faster based on new computational viewpoints and algorithms,\n- grounded in recent theory on continuous-time memorization, allowing it to address realistic time series of thousands of steps.\n\nWe contrast the LSSL to prior works such as LTC in detail below. **We point out that the reviewer's primary concern around novelty compared to the DCM and LTC may be based on an accidental misunderstanding of the technical term \"bilinear\"**, which we elaborate on below.\n\nAdditionally, while the connections between CT and RNNs have indeed been studied in the past, **a major theme of this work is to also draw the connection between CT and convolutional models** - another major class of models that is usually treated separately from CTs and RNNs. This connection is made through a link to state-space models, another important system that has been well-studied in signal processing. We hope that our technical contributions will advance the understanding of how these fundamental models (CT, RNNs, CNNs, state spaces) relate to each other.\n\n### Empirical Contributions\n\nA central empirical contribution of our work is showing that our model is the first CT/recurrent model that succeeds in settings (such as healthcare and speech) involving **very long sequences** of 1000 to 40000 time steps. Although the reviewer has suggested several additional CT baselines [Hasani 2021, Lechner 2020, Lezcano-Casado 2019, Erichson 2021], all of them evaluated exclusively on short sequences of a few dozen to hundred steps. For example, the primary LTC baseline suggested by the reviewer explicitly mentions that it is not designed for long sequences [Hasani 2021, Sec 8]. We would also like to note that the submission already includes many recent CT models as baselines (Table 5, Table 9).\n\nBelow, we have added additional experiments with direct comparisons to all of the proposed baselines, where the **LSSL still surpasses the performance of these baselines on the short tasks** (e.g. length 32 to 256) considered in these previous works.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, the **LSSL is clearly distinguished from previous continuous-time models** in the following ways, among others:\n* Novel application of a fundamental linear ODE (the state space equation), compared to standard CT models which learn a parameterized nonlinear ODE\n* Multiple conceptual viewpoints (recurrent, convolutional) allowing computation 100x or more faster than other CT models\n* Generalization of recent theory on continuous-time memorization (HiPPO), allowing handling extremely long sequences that have not previously been possible with CT/recurrent models.\n\n",

Related work is adequately cited. \n    \n    Quality: \n    The authors show empirically that their algorithm, Cluster-Margin, is both more efficient (O(nlog(n) vs O(n\u221a(n)) than CoreSet and BADGE in practice and more effective. In particular, the algorithm clearly outperforms CoreSet, BADGE, Margin and Random on the Open Images dataset. The algorithm requires 29% less labels than the second-best model in the 100k batch-size setting and 60% less labels in the 1M batch-size setting to achieve the same result (mAP). Cluster-Margin also outperforms all other methods on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and obtains a similar performance on SVHN. \n    \n    The authors also establish a theoretical guarantee for the Cluster-MarginV algorithm and show that those results hold for the Cluster-Margin algorithm in specific settings. In particular, they show that the Cluster-MarginV algorithm has a label complexity bound which improves over the Margin algorithm by a factor beta. They also show that this improvement is possible, under specific hypotheses like an optimal volume-based sampler, when the dimensionality of the embedding space is small or when the batch size k is large. They also show that the optimal volume-based sampler is approximately equivalent to the Cluster-Margin algorithm. They finally show that log(k) is an upper bound on the improvement of query complexity for any sampler. \n    The authors are aware and mention that their theoretical results are initial and that equating volume based samplers and the Cluster-Margin algorithm is an open research question. \n    \n    Clarity: \n    The paper is very clear and well organized. The authors detail the hyper-parameters and compute details used for the experiments. The Cluster-Margin algorithm is also explained in detail.  \n    \n    Significance: \n    The results are important as the algorithm allows for more efficient and effective large-batch-size active learning compared to existing methods.

The empirical evaluation shows remarkable results compared to the baselines considered.\n\n**Clarity** - Overall, the paper is written well. The ideas presented may very well be the basis for future work.\nMy problem here is that the bottom line is not clearly stated, rather it\u2019s implicit and a reader must go back and forth to understand the big picture. I think an implementation subsection may help make things clearer.\n\n**Significance** - The subject of improving recurrent networks for long time dependency is a very important topic. This paper suggests a new scheme, improving on existing ones significantly. In addition, the theoretical analysis may also lead to other parameterizations for continuous linear dynamical systems.\n\nAdditional comments:\n1. Lines 58-59 - this connection is an important part of this work, it should be included at least in the appendix, also in order to implement an arbitrary convolution with a linear dynamical system, the dimensionality of the RNN must be larger than that of the 1d convolution.\n2. Lines 113-116 - something seems wrong here (perhaps one of the $\\Delta t$ is a typo), if you set $\\alpha=0$ you get $x(t+\\Delta t)=(I+\\Delta t A)x(t)+\\Delta tB u(t)\\Delta t$ which can be written as $x(t+\\Delta t)=x(t)+\\Delta t(Ax(t)+ \\Delta t Bu(t))$, but $x\u2019(t)=Ax(t)+Bx(t)$.\n3. Lines 119-120 - this is confusing, it is clear the paper continues with $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$, A and B are not a function of $\\Delta t$, why denote them as such?\n4. Lines 186-188 - this statement is misleading, the overall functions that can be expressed with deep linear RNNs is still linear in the inputs, the statement implies otherwise.\n5. Theorem 1 - the citation of [8] is in italic.\n6. Corollary 4.1 - quasiseparable should be defined prior to the corollary.\n7. Section 5.1 - the margins are so narrow here, reporting std is a must.\n8. Line 310 - shouldn\u2019t $\\Delta t$ be a scalar? why is it O(H) parameters?\n9. The learning setup is not clear from the main paper, what is the eventual optimization problem that is being minimized, how is $\\Delta t$ parameterized in the learning setup. It is clear that the paper discusses special structures for A which are favorable in terms of computation but a reader is left a bit puzzled as to what it actually done in practice.

We first respond to the reviewer\u2019s main remarks on experimental protocol and error bars, and then respond in detail to the comments and questions.\n\n> Model Implementation\n\nWe agree that important end-to-end model details should be moved from Appendix A to the main body for clarity, which is done in the revised paper. Conceptually, the end-to-end model is similar to a 1-D CNN with the convolutions replaced by LSSL layers, and the rest of the learning setup is exactly as in previous works on our datasets (all of which were used in prior work). See also response to Reviewer ZFwG for ablations on model architecture and tuning.\n\n> Experimental Protocol\n\nFor space reasons, the detailed experimental protocol is in Appendix D. We hope that the above description of the end-to-end model also clarifies the learning setup and protocol. Code reproducing the experiments is provided in the supplemental and will be released.\n\n> Standard Deviation\n\nWe note that \u201cmargins are narrow\u201d only on the MNIST datasets which have been extensively evaluated in the literature. Here we provide the full mean/std results for SLLSSL corresponding to Tables 2, 3, and 5, which are all substantially better than the baselines, accounting for error bars:\n- sMNIST: 99.52 \u00b1 0.01\n- pMNIST: 98.74 \u00b1 0.04\n- sCIFAR: 84.52 \u00b1 0.21\n- BIDMC RR: .356 \u00b1 .004\n- BIDMC HR: .489 \u00b1 .057\n- BIDMC SpO2: .147 \u00b1 .008\n- Speech Commands Raw: 95.54 \u00b1 0.33\n\nThe reason std is not reported in the original tables is for consistency and formatting considerations: **our results compare directly to best numbers reported in the previous papers, many of which did not include error bars**.

Nonetheless, I would have some questions for the authors.\n\n### Learning $\\Delta t$ and Matching the Input and Output Times\n\nThe main issue of the paper as I understand it is how the learned timesteps are handled with respect to the input time series temporality. In Lemma 3.1, the learned $\\Delta t$ most likely does not correspond to the actual temporal discrepancy between $x_t$ and $x_{t+1}$ (i.e., $\\Delta t \\neq 1$). This decorrelates the step size $\\Delta t$ and the temporality of $x$ from the temporality of the input $u$, at least when following the dynamical system interpretation of Equation (3). Could the authors clarify this point, and in particular explain how this does not partly invalidate the dynamical viewpoint of LSSL?\n\n### Sequence to Sequence Tasks\n\nTo the best of my understanding, all considered tasks in the experiments of the paper deal with classification and regression to scalar values. This is unfortunate, given that the proposed architecture is a sequence-to-sequence model. Could any sequence-to-sequence task may be considered?\n\n### Generalization Vs. Approximation\n\nThe claim of lines 57-58 that LSSL generalizes convolutions and CNNs should be corrected, as it is shown in Section 3.2 that it can only approximate them, which is substantially different.\n\n\n## Writing\n\nThis submission can be difficult to read for the uninitiated reader given the information density and high number of introduced notions. Nonetheless, the claims and results presented by the authors are clear and well explained throughout the paper, especially as the submission is fully self-contained thanks to a thorough appendix.\n\n\n\n## Overall Sentiment\n\nWhile the submission externally seems solid, I am unable to commit to a strong acceptation recommendation due to the aforementioned inherent time constraints of the NeurIPS reviewing system. Therefore, and partly because of the concerns expressed above, I am only suggesting a \"Marginally above the acceptance threshold\", but I am strongly willing to change my score following the authors' response and discussion phase with the other reviewers.\n\n\n***\n\n## Post-Rebuttal Update\n\nI acknowledge the authors' response and thank them for their answers. The responses to all reviewers are thorough and seem to tackle the raised concerns, especially regarding readability and positioning. As far as I am concerned, my concerns are appropriately addressed. In particular, I believe that the solutions proposed by the authors will improve the quality of the submission.\n\nTherefore, within the already exposed limits of my appreciation, I think that this paper can be accepted, thus raising my score to \"Good paper, accept\" but keeping my low confidence rating.\n\n**Second update:** Following the authors' convincing responses and further investigation, I still think that this paper should be accepted but with a higher confidence. I consequently choose to raise my confidence score.",
    "comment": "We sincerely appreciate the reviewer\u2019s time and thoughtful review, which raised insightful points that have helped us improve the exposition in the revised paper. Despite the constraints imposed by the NeurIPS system, we believe that the reviewer\u2019s summary, comments, and questions demonstrate understanding of the main points of this work. We respond to each detailed comment below.\n\n\n\n> Learning $\\Delta t$\n\nAn input sequence does not necessarily have an intrinsic timescale $\\Delta t$, and it is instead up to the model to choose a resolution for the sequence, motivating the importance of learning the timescale. Conceptually, the model simply sees a discrete sequence of numbers and chooses to process it \u201cas if\u201d it were sampled at a rate of $\\Delta t$.\n\nFor a more intuitive interpretation, consider the special case when A corresponds to a uniform measure (in the literature known as the LMU [Voelker et al. 2019] or HiPPO-LegT [Gu et al. 2020] matrix). Then for a fixed $\\Delta t$, equation (3) is simply memorizing the input within sliding windows of $\\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$ elements, and equation (4) extracts features from this window. Thus one interpretation is that the SLLSSL automatically learns convolution filters with a **learnable kernel width** $\\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$.\n\nWe will include this simpler interpretation of the timescale $\\Delta t$ in the revised paper.\n\n> Sequence to Sequence Tasks\n\nWe agree that sequence to sequence tasks are a particularly suitable domain for the LSSL, where its dual interpretations as recurrent or convolutional can be most effective. Our updated experiments include examples of sequence to sequence tasks previously considered in the literature, where LSSLs outperform all baselines by 10-20% reduction in RMSE (see \u201cHalf-Cheetah\u201d and \u201cWalker2d\u201d experiments in the response to Reviewer LpSP).\n\nWe are excited about future applications of LSSLs in areas that require sequence to sequence models such as audio generation, where the theoretical and computational advantages of LSSLs may shine.\n\n> Generalization vs. Approximation\n\nWe agree with the reviewer\u2019s more precise phrasing of this claim. Colloquially, we meant that \u201cLSSLs generalize convolutions\u201d with a limiting argument, in the same sense as \u201cneural networks are universal approximators\u201d. More precisely, LSSLs do generalize all convolutions in the limit as the state size N goes to infinity; for any finite N they approximate convolutions. We will make this wording more precise.\n",

    "comment": "We are glad the reviewer found the ideas in the paper interesting and appreciate their constructive clarification questions, which have helped us to improve the draft. The reviewer\u2019s main concerns were (1) clarity of model details in the main body, (2) questions about the model architecture and (3) validity of the SoTA results, in particular with respect to tuning. In brief:\n\n1) In the expanded responses below, we have provided references to descriptions of model details from the original submission. We thank the reviewer for pointing out details that may be confusing, and we will highlight them better in the main body of the revised paper. We also mention that our full submitted code will be publicly released.\n\n2) The reviewer is **concerned that components such as residuals and layernorm affect the formulation of our proposed LSSL module**. We note that our deep architecture is very standard -- appearing in many of our baselines -- and does not impact the conceptual contributions of this paper. The submission includes theory and ablations that validate that our empirical results come from LSSL and not the deep architecture (see detailed response 6a). At the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have additionally run more ablations to substantiate this. In summary, a **pure LSSL network with no residuals or normalization layers still outperforms all baselines on our datasets** (see \u201cAdditional Ablations\u201d response).\n\n3) We disagree with the reviewer\u2019s claim that **\u201csimple tuning of baselines such as LSTMs would make them achieve SoTA\u201d**. We emphasize that all experiments in the paper compared directly against previously reported results in their exact experimental settings [Line 257], where these baselines have been tuned extensively by previous works. Our method actually requires less tuning than baselines [Line 329-336], which is further substantiated by our additional experiments where LSSL outperforms several more methods on 3 new tasks with no tuning (see response to Reviewer LpSP). On the LSTM claim in particular, see response 6a.\n",

    "review": "Overall, the proposed method is well-motivated by theoretical results and appears to have strong experimental evidence, but there is a concern about experimental protocol and there are various claims that need more justification and clarification.\n\nThe proposed reformulation of offline RL using the viewpoint of convex optimization appears to be novel, given the accuracy of the summary of related work. This motivates the proposed method, ICQ, to avoid the use of unseen state-action pairs, which would have contributed to error in previous methods. The improvement due to avoiding the use of unseen pairs is shown in a didactic finite game, and further validated in higher dimensional environments.\n\nTheorems 1 and 2 are useful for motivating the method. I am slightly concerned about the author's claim in line 165 that the importance sampling weight does not involve $\\pi$. How can $Q^{\\pi_k}$ in equation (9) be accurately estimated if not all possible state-action pairs, which involves unseen pairs, are used? This doesn't seem to be a serious issue because $Q^{\\pi_k}$ is evaluated only under the behavioral distribution when it appears in equation (11). Nonetheless, the authors may wish to rephrase line 165.\n\nLines 30-32 says \"we demonstrate that unseen state-action pairs will grow exponentially as the number of agents increases...\". Where does this paper demonstrate it? The exponential growth is obvious and I don't think it needs justification, but I didn't see the \"demonstration\" anywhere in the paper (the 2-state game in Figure 1 is just an example). The phrasing makes it seem that the authors are claiming something more than this obvious fact, but I don't think that's the case, so I recommend rewording it.\n\nLine 76-77: it's not clear what is the exact operation that \"mask\" means. Does BCQ avoid using unseen pairs by \"masking\" (i.e. setting to those Q values to zero)? If so, how is that fundamentally different from the way ICQ avoids using unseen pairs?\n\nIn line 95-96, how is $\\epsilon_b$ different from $\\epsilon_u$? Are they actually the same? Are you saying that $\\epsilon_s$ for seen pairs is set to zero? This is confusing.\n\nLine 162-163: computing the partition function in ICQ seems to be a hard subtask. How is this tractable for continuous state and continuous action spaces?\n\nLine 184: Does $n$-step evaluation strictly lead to zero bias, i.e. \"eliminate\", as the paper says?\n\nLine 228-231: Since this paper does not compare with the methods AWR and ABM, how can the authors claim that their method has \"much more efficient learning\"?\n\nI am concerned about the experimental protocol. In section 6.1, the paper says that the hyperparameters for the baseline methods BCQ and CQL were taken from those that the original papers provided. Were the hyperparameters of BCQ and CQL already tuned for StarCraft II? If not, and if this paper did not tune the baselines for the tasks used in this paper, then the comparisons are not fair. Could the authors address this issue?\n\nThe organization of the paper needs improvement. Section 3.2 Toy Example compares the proposed method ICQ with the baseline BCQ, but ICQ hasn't even been described yet.\n\nMinor comments:\n1. The acronym \"MMDP\" first occurs in Figure 1 without saying what it stands for.\n2. Line 126: \"QMIX\" appears for the first time here without saying what it stands for, and without a citation to the QMIX paper.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAfter rebuttal: the authors have addressed all of my original questions and have promised to update the paper with extra experimental results and explanations based on the discussion during this review process, so I am raising the score from 6 to 7.",

    "review": "This paper is well-motivated - the problem of offline learning from a static dataset is well known and its challenges have been studied in terms of unseen actions during value-function training. The authors also state in the appendix that the coordinated setting is a limitation, but this is a reasonable starting point for this work. The results and experiments are extensive and very convincing. I also appreciate the simplification of the algorithm over the BCQ baseline, which requires training an additional generative model and perturbation model. The main concern I have is surrounding the clarity. \n\nMy main questions are around the derivation of the forward KL objective. Specifically, I am not clear on what the target of the normalization constant should be. It is also not clear from the B.4 section of the appendix, and I would like to have seen a more detailed derivation from equations 31 to 32. There are other works that derive a policy optimization objective from the forward KL, the partition function is computed by integrating over actions, for example in the M-step of MPO algorithm (Abdolmaleki 2018). In the practical algorithm, this is approximated by sampling several actions for a given state and taking the softmax. In this paper, however, I am not sure what the normalizing constant should be capturing. In the practical algorithm, it seems you are taking a softmax accross the batch dimension as you state, which I interpret as integrating over actions and states. However, the motivation behind this is confusing to me without seeing more detailed steps. Finally, this raises a question for me in terms of the practical consideration of batch-size.

    "review": " \nThe proposed method ICQ for single-agent RL bears some resemblance to AWR and the main novelty comes from the critic loss, where the target Q(s\u2019, a\u2019) is reweighed by the importance sampling weight. The paper had a good theoretical analysis of most of the claims it made. The experiments clearly shows that the proposed method ICQ and ICQ-MA does not suffer from Q function over-estimation problem. \n \nThis paper contains several strong aspects. The usage of the importance sampling ratio in the update of the Q function is novel afaik. The intersection of Offline RL and Multi-agent RL is novel and deserves more consideration. And the long standing problem of value overestimation can benefit from the contributions of this paper. The experimental and the ablation study results look sound -- starting with a toy environment as a motivation, then moving on to more complicated benchmarks.\n \nOne major point that was unclear was whether ICQ should be solely used in a multi-agent env, or does the method work equally well in a single-agent env. More specifically, In l127, you mentioned that the unseen (s,a) pairs grow exponentially with the number of agents. Is that because the amount of data collected is held fixed while the joint action space A of all of the agents increases exponentially with the number of agents? If so, I wonder whether the better performance is because ICQ is better than BCQ at handling additional dimensionality in the state-action space, or because it is better at multi-agent data specifically. I imagine a relatively straightforward way to test this is to hold the dimensionality of (s,a) constant by add dummy observation dimensions to the two-agent toy env and compare two-agent+dummy v.s. four-agent. \n \n \nAdditionally, I am uncertain around the following points\n \n1. In l87, what is $Q^\\pi_B$ exactly? Is that just the expected value of $r + Q(s\u2019, a\u2019)$ over the batch of $(s,a,r,s\u2019)$ and $a\u2019\\sim\\pi(s,a)$? Or is that what $Q^\\pi$ converges to when only using data from B?\n2. In l96 around the fixed additional error. Do you assume here that seen pairs will have an exact estimate and 0 or close to 0 error?\n3. In l56, it is not immediately obvious what does \u201call agents share the same reward function\u201d may imply. Does that restrict us to a cooperative environment? Because the given reward function is a function of the env state, not the agent\u2019s observation. I think you may have meant the latter.\n\n\nOther suggestions for better readability/clarity: \n1. In the paper, it is not clear that the optimal policy in eq 8 is already proposed in AWR (Peng et al. 2019). \n2. L31-32  \u201cunseen state-action pairs will grow exponentially as the number of agents increases in multi-agent systems\u201d It is not immediately clear why it is exponential and I think it\u2019s only mentioned once in l127. You\u2019ve shown that the error grows linearly with the number of agents in Theorem 2. It might be more clear if you drop the exponential part.\n3. In 6.1 you mentioned that StarCraft II is deterministic. That is in fact not the case. See [this link](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2/blob/master/docs/environment.md#determinism-and-randomness)\n4. In 6.1 and elsewhere, it is unclear from the paper whether a) the paper tested its agents on the full StarCraft II game or specialized maps; b) whether the environment is two-player or 2+; c) whether the goal is competitive or cooperative.  That information is available in the DOP, but is worth specifying again for the readers unfamiliar with that work or with StarCraft. \n5. There is a typo in l104 I believe. Did you mean \u201cby optimizing $\\pi(a'_u | s'_s)$\u201d?\n\n-------Updated review----\n\nAfter the rebuttal, the author added results for the single agent use cases, which makes the proposed algorithm (ICQ) applicable to more domains beyond the multi-agent use case. The authors also improved the clarity of the paper and added discussions around the pros and cons of ICQ. The changes made the paper stronger and thus merit a re-evaluation of the score. I\u2019ve changed my ratings accordingly.",

In Figure 4, the behavioral cloning overrate the rest of the competitor algorithms except ICQ-MA, which seems to be due to the deterministic nature of the SMAC environment. Thus, the success of ICQ-MA seems to be a weighted loss trading off the behavior cloning error and the implicitly constrained Bellmann error. That means, if ICQ-MA does not exist, behaviorial cloning is the best way to do multi-agent offline RL?\n\n3. I feel there is a lack of explanations to the theorems in the main text, one has to go to the proof to understand what is the intention, although some details can be guessed, but it might be better for them to be elaborated in the main text.\n\n4. The partition function Z is approximated in a min-batch, is there some analysis on the potential effect? How is Z calculated exactly?\n\n5. Eqn (11), the loss is the KL divergence between $\\pi_{k+1}$ and $\\pi_{\\theta}$, taking expectation with respect to the state distribution of the behavior policy, can this be roughly described as making as little change to the current policy?  \n\n\n6. In the derivation of Eqn (11) in step (a), the entropy term of $\\pi_{k+1}$ is dropped in the optimization due to it is not related to $\\theta$, I have not fully understood why this entropy part has no theta involved?\n\n",

UDA is a highly explored area and new contributions should introduce novel\u00a0ideas that\u00a0can address\u00a0existing challenges or boost state-of-the-art\u00a0performances significantly. More specifically, the idea of using prototypes for UDA has been explored extensively in the literature. Transport-based optimization also has been used extensively for this purpose. Source-free UDA algorithms based on using prototypes have been developed as well, e.g.,:\n\n- Universal domain adaptation through self-supervision, NeurIPS 2020\n\n- Unsupervised model adaptation for continual semantic segmentation, AAAI 2021\n\nIt is true the proposed algorithm is different in the idea implementation details but the broad solution is not novel due to the precedent. Performance results also do not demonstrate a significant boost over prior works. Finally, there is no theoretical analysis to improve our understanding about using a similar approach to address UDA. Hence, I think this work is not suitable for publication at NeurIPS.\n\n2. Recent UDA algorithms perform more extensive experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of the method and offer benefits over prior works.

    "comment": "Thank you for thoroughly going through our paper and providing constructive comments. Below please find our point-by-point response to your comments.\n\n\n>*It would be more convincing if the author can prove the originality and show the main difference from the above paper. Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation via Minimax Entropy*\n\n  \n\n- The prototype-oriented UDA framework that integrates the prototype idea into a bi-directional transport loss is an original contribution of this paper. It allows us to estimate class proportions, handle the class-imbalance issue, and apply the same model in four different UDA settings (single source, multi-source, class-imbalance, and source-private), achieving state-of-the-art performance while having low computation and memory cost.\n\n  \n\n- We agree that using learnable prototypes, which are linear classifiers\u2019 weights, for UDA has already appeared in Saito et al. (ICCV, 2019), which is cited in Section 2.2.1 of our paper when discussing the connections to entropy minimization. We will also cite their paper in the section where we discuss our prototype construction. However, there are at least three key differences. First, they use entropy minimization to align target features to the prototypes whereas we use a bi-directional transport loss. In our ablation study, we make a connection between a one directional (target-to-prototype) transport loss with entropy minimization. This ablation study shows that using this loss alone (similar to entropy minimization) leads to worse performance. Second, Saito et al. (ICCV, 2019) use labeled target examples to construct prototypes, which are not available in our setting. Finally, the proposed prototype-oriented framework allows us to naturally estimate class proportions to handle class imbalance, a problem that is not addressed in Saito et al. (ICCV, 2019).\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n>*However, I have one concern related to the quality of this paper. Comparison with proposed baselines seems to be insufficient. Specifically, the proposed method needs to be compared with other prototype-based alignment methods.*\n\n  \n  \n\n- #### Comparison with CAN (Kang, CVPR 2019):\n\n  \n\n     - We will add CAN into comparison for the single-source setting: CAN achieves 90.6% in Office-31 and 65.7% in Office-Home (the result of CAN on Office-Home is quoted from Li et al. (CVPR, 2020)). By comparison, the proposed PCT achieves 90.0% in Office-31 and 71.8% in Office-Home. We note that CAN utilizes source samples to initialize K-means to cluster target samples in each iteration, making it much more computationally expensive and unsuitable for the source-private setting. We also note that different from previous UDA algorithms including ours that typically use domain-agnostic batch normalization, CAN uses domain-specific batch normalization, which is shown to be helpful in boosting its performance.\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n- #### Comparison with Prototypical Cross-Domain (Yue, CVPR, 2021):\n\n  \n\n    - Our performance is better than theirs while being more computationally efficient. They use memory banks and K-means in each iteration to obtain prototypes whereas we simply use the classifier's weight to construct prototypes, saving computation time significantly.\n\n    - In the single-source setting, our average accuracy is higher by 0.2% (90.0 vs 89.8) in the Office-31 dataset and 1.2% (71.8 vs 70.6) in the Office-Home dataset.\n\n\n\n>*I am curious what kind of limitations that this paper could have when compared with other prototype-based alignment papers.*\n\n- Currently, our method is limited to the closed-set domain adaptation setting. There are other prototype-based methods that can handle unseen categories (Saito et al., NeurIPS 2020). It would be interesting to see whether we can extend the proposed PCT method to handle unseen categories, while maintaining its good performance in the closed-set setting.\n\n  $~$\n\n**References:**\n\n  \n\nKang, G., Jiang, L., Yang, Y., & Hauptmann, A.

This would enforce the target domain to acquire the semantics learned by the source domain. I agree that this would lead to a more stable training, however, this restriction may not be suitable in category-shift scenarios (e.g., see [P2]). Could the authors comment on this aspect?*\n\n  \n\n- We assume a shared latent space between the source and target features while Kundu et al. (ECCV, 2020) learn separate latent spaces. In the closed-domain adaptation where the categories are the same, we believe this is a reasonable assumption since the semantics of the features from the source domain should be similar to those from the target domain. Otherwise, it might be impossible to do domain adaptation. If we need to handle additional categories, $\\mu$ could still be used to initialize the target prototypes since it encodes information about the distribution of the source data. However, care must be taken since allowing $\\mu$ to update without the source data could lead to catastrophic forgetting (Goodfellow, 2013). Thus, we will need to add an extra mechanism to deal with this problem.\n\n\n\n>*Comparison with prior works: There are several source-data free approaches in the literature [P1, P2] that have been missed in the related work. In particular, [P2] also uses a prototype based metadata to perform \u201csource-free\u201d adaptation, however recommends using separate latent spaces for source and target domain. IMO, these should be discussed in the related work since ideas such as source-data-private setting, and compact feature clusters are already described in these works.*\n\n  \n\n- Thank you for pointing out the references. We will discuss these works in more detail in the final version of the paper.\n\n  \n\n- Both Kundu et al. ( ECCV, 2020; CVPR, 2020) use Gaussian prototypes to model each source class distribution. In addition to the parameters for the mean vectors and covariance matrices for each Gaussian, this approach requires an additional decoder network G to compute the reconstruction loss, increasing the memory footprint. While this strategy has an advantage in the category-shift setting, we believe linear classifier's weights are enough to encode information about the source distribution in the closed-set domain adaptation setting. Additionally, our framework also allows us to naturally estimate class proportions to handle class imbalance, a problem that is not addressed in both papers.\n\n\n\n>*L86: \u201cmissing classes\u201d: It is unclear what is meant by the term \u201cmissing classes\u201d here. Does it imply that the method is applicable under category-shift scenario as well (e.g. open-set domain adaptation).*\n\n  \n\n- When we refer to missing classes here, we mean the classes that are not present in the sampled mini-batch. For example, if we have 100 classes and our mini-batch size is 64, some of the classes will definitely be missing. Matching samples with samples could lead to a potential class mismatch. However, the prototypes, the representatives of all the classes, will be available at every iteration. We will modify this sentence to make it more clear.\n\n  \n\n\n>*Classical DA methods work under the theoretical framework of [5] where the adapted model\u2019s generalization bound depends on three terms (source-domain error, divergence between the domains, a constant that depends on the chosen hypothesis space). Here however, in the source-private-data setting, the source domain error becomes immaterial since the feature extractor is updated solely based on the target domain. It would be good to see some theoretical discussion on why the proposed method works (since the adapted feature extractor would not be ideal for the source domain). An interesting analysis could be analyzing the performance of source domain data on the adapted model.*\n\n  \n\n- Since we fix $\\mu$, which encodes information about the distribution of the source sampes, target samples will be aligned to source samples in the latent space. This will decrease the divergence between domains (the second term in the bound). As expected, the model trained on the source domain is going to perform worse on the source data given the adaptation to the target domain. While the first term (source domain errors) increases due to the adaptation, the second term ( divergence between the domains) decreases. Thus, it is inconclusive whether this bound will become looser or tighter.\n\n  \n\n- We provide two tables to show the source errors as well as target errors before and after target domain adaptation (Office-31 dataset).\n\n    - | Source Error | A2D   | A2W   | D2A   | D2W   | W2A   | W2D   |\n| ------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Before       | 0.99% | 0.90% | 1.00% | 1.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% |\n| After        | 4.90% | 4.93% | 9.04% | 1.00% | 4.91% | 0.10% |\n| Diff         | 3.91% | 4.03% | 8.04% | 0.00% | 4.91% | 0.10% | \n\n    - | Target Error | A2D      | A2W      | D2A      | D2W     | W2A      | W2D     |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- |\n| Before       | 19.28%   | 22.01%   | 40.08%   | 5.03%   | 37.06%   | 1.61%   |\n| After        | 7.80%    | 8.30%    | 26.00%   | 2.10%   | 25.40%   | 0.10%   |\n| Diff         | \\-11.48% | \\-13.71% | \\-14.08% | \\-2.93% | \\-11.66% | \\-1.51% |\n\n$~$\n\n**References:**\n\nGoodfellow, I.

However, this is just one part of their model, and further formulating the alignment in a two way conditional distributional setting and estimating class priors together is novel as of my knowledge.  \n\n\n- Defining the pointwise cost between a prototype and target as doc product makes the whole t->p cost an entropy minimization term, this idea is simple, but the connection is a nice contribution.\n\n\n- The related work is almost sufficiently cited in my opinion, however a couple of citations might worth adding[2,3,4]\n\n\n#### *Quality:*\n\n- The claims are supported well in a couple of different ways: \n\n    - The visualizations over synthetic data (Figure 1, 2 and 3) are well designed and convincing. \n    - The experiments are extensive and apparently superior \n    - Table 6 is a good ablation study that decreases the doubt about the roles of each loss term or their direct alternatives.\n    - The connections to the clustering and optimality are simple but enough support.\n\n\n - Did you achieve the results on Figure 1b by training a simple case(like Figure 2) or is it just an abstract scenario in order to visualize your idea?\n\n\n- How would you extend your algorithm to the cases of unseen classes?

We will discuss and cite them in the final paper if you could provide their titles.\n\n  \n>*Did you achieve the results on Figure 1b by training a simple case(like Figure 2) or is it just an abstract scenario in order to visualize your idea?*\n\n  \n\n- Figure 1b is an abstract scenario to help visualize the key idea of the proposed method. It tells the same story as the simulated data set shown in Figure 2 does.\n\n  \n\n>*How would you extend your algorithm to the cases of unseen classes? Would it work by adding nodes and prototypical weights to the output layer?*\n\n  \n\n- As you pointed out, we could add another node of a prototype weight to model out-of-distribution samples (OOD). Instead of predicting K classes, we will predict K+1 classes where the last class is preserved for OOD samples. This scheme, however, will require sampling OOD data, whose space can be arbitrarily large, to train the classifier. If we want to predict the unseen classes, we will need some labeled samples for the novel classes. In this case, we can introduce new prototypes for these samples.\n\n  \n  \n\n>*The last layer is actually a direct representative of the source classes, is this allowed within the data-privacy practices?*\n\n  \n  \n\n- While the weights represent the source samples, to the best of our knowledge, the risk of leaking information about the individual users is at least as low as that in Federated Learning (McMahan, B., Moore, E., Ramage, D., Hampson, S., & y Arcas, B. A.. Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data. AISTATS, 2017), where privacy is of utmost concern. In the Federated Learning settings, to learn a machine learning model, the whole model instead of data is sent to clients to help protect user's privacy. Similar to Federated Learning, the proposed algorithm sends only the model rather than the source data to the target domain. Thus, we believe it is suitable in the privacy-sensitive setting.\n\n  \n\n>*The authors mentioned advantages of their method(other than main contributions) throughout the paper(such as imbalance, missing class within a batch, parameter costs, outlier robustness etc.) these arguments could be given in a more compact way and in one place.*\n\n  \n\n- We hoped to emphasize the general applicability of our method so we mentioned the different applications throughout the paper. We will revise the final paper and make the argument more compact per the suggestion.\n\n  \n\n\n",

    "comment": "We fully agree with the evaluation written and thank the reviewer for her/his time and energy. \n\nThe reviewer writes \"Also, it would be helpful to have the contribution of this paper more expounded upon especially in relations to the other related work. For instance, it has been known how to leverage Blackwell approachability to derive online calibration, and Gupta et al shows using techniques similar to blackwell approachability how to achieve online multicalibration (groupwise calibration). These kinds of discussions seem to be missing.\"\n--> We acknowledge how online calibration can be solved by Blackwell's approachability on page 3, lines 115\u2013116: ``Mannor and Stoltz [17] and Abernethy et al. [1] rewrote the problem of approximate calibration as an approachability problem as follows [\u2026]\u2019' \n--> It is true that because of space constraints we did not discuss in detail the results of Gupta et al (2021)---and neither did we for H\u00e9bert-Johnson et al. (2018)---but we cite both papers twice on the first page of the submission, acknowledging that they also considered group-wise calibration. A detailed discussion of our results compared to the ones of Gupta et al. (2021) would be along the following lines: There are key differences between our framework and that of Gupta et al (2021). Indeed, Gupta et al (2021) allow the player to observe the sensitive context (group G in their notation), while we mainly focus on the unawareness setup (s_t is not necessarily revealed, in our notation). The knowledge of the group membership is crucial for their Algorithm 2, which explicitly relies on it; even simpler, when the groups are known, one could simply run several calibration algorithms (one per group) in parallel. Also, the group structure in Gupta et al (2021) is different from ours. In our case it has stochastic nature, while they work with deterministic, possibly overlapping, groups (but known beforehand).\n\nThe reviewer also writes \"In terms of the impossibility results...\"\n--> See Part I of Section A of the supplementary material: if the condition is not met, there exists a mixed action for Nature (to be used at each round) such that the player will always be \\alpha-away from the target, i.e., that no online learnability is possible. This follows from Blackwell's original (1956) approach and corresponds to the necessity part of the approachability theorem. The contribution by Abernethy et al (2011) is providing something different---a different proof of the sufficiency part of the approachability theorem, based on online linear optimization. \n\nThe discussions above will included in the revised version.\n\nThe reviewer asks \"In section 6, it's not clear to me how \\hat{C}_r is constructed to estimate the unknown set C.\"\n--> Indeed, the construction is idiosyncratic; we provide an example of such a construction in Section D.1 of the supplementary material for the case of group-wise calibration under a demographic parity constraint (= the case discussed in Section 5). We will better highlight the fact that the target estimates construction have to be problem dependent. \n\nWe agree with all minor comments/suggestions and will implement them. \n\nWe will write a paragraph on the limitations, discussing the complexity of the algorithm in terms of the numbers of groups.",

Of particular interest is the fact that the authors are able to provide new (to the best of my knowledge) results on the trade-off that is achievable between group-wise calibration and demographic parity. \n- The authors provide rates of convergence based on the Blackwell approachability framework.\n- They extend their results to the case where the set to approach is unknown, and show how to use this extension to provide convergence results even when some of the priors on the probability of being in each group is unknown to the learner. \n\nWeaknesses:\n- It is a bit hard from reading the paper to figure out what are the authors\u2019 contributions versus what is new.

We will definitely improve the discussion of literature to make this clear. Our main contribution (and other reviewers agree on this) is to attack online learning under fairness constraints in a unified way through Blackwell's approachability.

    "review": "I believe that this paper is an important and timely contribution to the literature of online fair learning. It successfully adapts Blackwell \napproachability to handle the case of both sensitive and non-sensitive stochastic contexts coming from a fixed but unknown distribution.\nIt is important that, subject to a technical assumption, the framework developed by the authors provides \"if and only if\" learnability results, as well as\nthat it gives explicit rates in the learnable case. Further, while the main assumption (fast sequential estimation of the contextual distribution) may\nappear technical, it is easily satisfied in most important online fairness settings studied in the literature, and thus poses virtually no problem \nin terms of the generality of the \"if and only if\" results. \n\nFrom my perspective, the identification of Pareto frontiers for group calibration under \nthe parity constraint is a crucial contribution of this paper. (I would like to point out, in conjunction with this, that while considering the case \nS = {0, 1} is a good choice presentation-wise, but it does not immediately appear clear to me how Propositions 2 and 3 regarding the Pareto optimal curve \nmight look like for more general sets S.)\n\nThe proofs are involved, and might be amenable to a more compact exposition. That said, the authors do a good job with helping the reader keep track of\nthe various assumptions made at various junctures in the proofs.\n\nSome minor corrections:\n-The display below line 91, the second regret term should be r(a, b_t, x_t, s_t), not r(a'_s, b_t, x_t, s_t).\n-Line 144, I believe it should say \"perfect knowledge of the former\", not \"the latter\" (the former being the payoff functions, which are \nexposed to the learner as per line 55).\n-Line 162, I suggest adding the word \"below\" after \"Assumption 1\", as the assumption has not been defined yet.",

    "review": "I think that the unified approach provided by the authors makes a nice contribution, as it allows a clean, elegant abstraction and understanding of multiple previously studied objectives and constraints. The suggested framework allows lifting and minimizing implementational details we have seen in previous work (for example, the authors give a condition which directly applies to the convergence rate of the empirical distribution estimate to the true underlying distribution, as opposed to, for example, a VC-bound), which abstracts these parts away, allowing to focus on the objectives and constraints in a cleaner way. \n\nEstablishing this unified approach is in my opinion the main contribution of the paper.

    "comment": " We generally agree with the evaluation written and thank the reviewer for her/his time and energy, including the fact that all the compatibility/incompatibility results exhibited were expected or even known. However, as underlined by another reviewer, the trade-off part (Section 5, when group-wise calibration is considered under a demographic parity constraint) is a crucial application of our unified framework. It was expected, of course, that the two criteria of group-wise calibration and demographic parity cannot be satisfied simultaneously in general, but we go beyond this incompatibility and describe the best possible trade-offs between the two conflicting criteria (accuracy vs. fairness). Our approach allows to obtain some optimal balance. \n\nComments/questions:\n1.

    "submission_title": "Asymptotically Best Causal Effect Identification with Multi-Armed Bandits",
    "review": "This paper attempts to provide a step towards identifying best available formula for the causal effect identification without deriving a solution from graphical criteria. Causal effect identification is posed as a sequential decision problem where the investigator chooses which observations to make and updates the beliefs regarding the available formulas. \n\nStrengths: \n-\tThe difference from the previous works is stated clearly. Some of the limitations of the recent works, e.g., practical constraints for selection methods based on graphical criteria, are addressed via estimating the asymptotic variance directly. \n-\tThe idea of framing this problem as a best-arm-identification bandits problem is simple yet effective. It may serve as a first step for solving more general problems as briefly touched in the discussion section.\n-\tThe main technical result is a novel confidence sequence for the sample-splitting estimator. It shows that having an uncentered influence function leads to a better convergence rate in terms of nuisance estimation. Since most causal estimators require a nuisance estimate, this can be a nice feature.\n-\tAdaptation of LUCB and SE bandit algorithms are sound.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-\tIn simulations section, the proposed algorithms are shown to require significantly smaller number of samples than uniform sampling at finding the optimal arm (best formula). However, only 9 formulas are considered. It would have been insightful to comment on the effect of the number of formulas, e.g., does scaling behavior bear similarities to the sample complexity results presented in the section 4.\n-\tThe general problem of trying to obtain the best estimate of the causal effect is briefly mentioned in the limitations section. The reviewer understands that this paper is a first step in that direction. Nevertheless, it would have been interesting to talk a bit more about the general problem. For instance, a discussion on the applicability of the methods employed in this paper to infinite-armed bandits setting would shed light on the importance of this work for the future research.\n",
    "comment": "Thank you for your encouraging remarks. \n\nWe believe that you have a firm grasp on our contributions. We would like to emphasize the importance of achieving a second-order dependence on the nuisance function estimation rates. We realised that we did not sufficiently highlight and explain its significance in the submission. We attempt to do this below (we will incorporate the explanation also in the paper).\n\nTheorem 1 implies that having an uncentered influence function is a sufficient condition for obtaining the second-order dependence on the rate of nuisance function estimation. Neyman orthogonality, while sufficient for predicting the causal contrast at a parametric rate, is not sufficient for predicting the variance at the parametric rate; a second-order result is generally not possible without an uncentered influence function.\n\n__Weaknesses__\n\n- _Number of formulas_:\nAn analysis on the effect of the number of formulas could indeed be insightful, thanks for the suggestion. We began by running experiments with 3, 4, 5, and 6  backdoor paths, obtaining 9, 17, 33 and 65 identification formulas respectively. The average sample complexity of the three algorithms, as a function of the number of formulas, are summarized in the table below. We can see that the benefits from using a bandit algorithm increase dramatically with the number of formulas; we also see that CS-LUCB is generally superior. We will add more exhaustive experiments to the paper.\n\n| Number of formulas | 9 | 17 | 33 | 65 |\n| --- | --- |--- | --- |--- | \n| CS-SE | 39,250 | 68,250 | 81,750 | 274,000 |\n| CS-LUCB | 40,000 | 53,500 | 59,500 | 110,500 |\n| Uniform | 118,125 | 320,875 | 313,500 | 4,810,000 |\n| CS-SE relative to uniform | 33% | 21% | 26% | 5.6% |\n| CS-LUCB relative to uniform | 33% | 17% | 19% | 2.3% |\n\n- _General problem_:\nGenerally, estimating causal effects from only observational data is the central problem in causal inference. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the problem of learning a causal effect from observational data as a sequential decision problem when you can change what covariates are observed. While we have made a first step by considering choosing between estimators, the general problem that simply tries to produce the best estimate of the causal effect under adaptive observations is wide open. This problem is significantly more difficult than the one we considered and will require a general theory of how to combine estimates from different formulas and different nuisance functions. We will add a discussion in the paper.\n\n- _Implication of our results for bandits_:\nWe neglected the impact of our techniques on the bandit literature. As you hinted, our confidence sequences on the variance could be an upgrade to algorithms in the infinite-armed bandit setting which use variance estimation (e.g. UCB-V or Bernstein-SiRI) when nuisance functions are present. Our method does not require each estimator to have the same expected value, so we could use it to solve best-arm-identification problems where \u201cbest\u201d refers to some risk-adjusted measure that depends on the variance in addition to the expected reward of an arm: the results from this paper would provide finite-sample confidence bounds on the variance, and we could use a similar decomposition to the one used in Theorem 1, or results from Foster and Syrgkanis 2019, to provide finite-sample confidence bounds on the mean estimate. In general, our work suggests the problem of bandits where the reward estimation requires nuisance functions rather than the almost ubiquitous empirical mean estimate. In particular, non-contextual bandit algorithms in online experimentation typically collect lots of user covariate data, so a theory of confidence intervals for estimators with nuisance parameters would allow the use of variance-reduced estimators using covariate adjustment. We will add this discussion in the paper.",

    "comment": "Thank you for your feedback and questions. We hope that our replies below provide some clarifications.\n\n\n__Asymptotic optimality__\n\nOur use of the term \u201casymptotically\u201d has created confusion; indeed, it refers to the formula/estimator that has the best asymptotic performance, but the bandit algorithm itself is not asymptotically optimal. We will make this distinction clear in the paper. On a side-note, we cannot apply track-and-stop style algorithms to our setting, since they rely on parametric assumptions about the reward distributions and all we can guarantee is a frequentist confidence sequence on the reward. Additionally, we could not use  the BAI algorithms known to be minimax optimal, such as lil\u2019UCB or Exponential Gap Elimination, for the following reasons. The stopping condition of lil\u2019UCB is triggered when one arm is sampled at a constant proportion, but the proof of correctness requires that the confidence bound widths shrink at the same rate for every arm, which is not necessarily true in our framework. The same difficulty arises in Exponential Gap Elimination and even Median Elimination; both algorithms also assume a uniform rate of decay of the bound widths across arms. Hence, we were forced to use the simpler algorithms LUCB and SE, which allow us to derive correctness and sample complexity results when the confidence intervals decay at arbitrary speeds. We will add this clarification to the paper.\n\n__Inefficient sampling__\n\nWe agree that simple sample splitting can be inefficient, as only half the data is used to fit the nuisance function. As you pointed out, an approach more similar to cross-fitting (as suggested by Chernozhukov et al. 2018, Kato et al. 2020) would instead enable us to use all the data. We used the simple sample-splitting estimator because the bandit algorithm requires finite-sample confidence intervals, which are difficult to obtain for the cross-fitted estimator. All the results we know of from the semi-parametric literature for the cross-fitted estimator (e.g. Chernozhukov et al. 2018) are asymptotic. Additionally, the errors of nuisance function estimates between different folds are dependent, which significantly complicates the analysis.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot see how the ADR estimator from Kato et al. 2020 will help. While a powerful result, that paper shows that asymptotic normality can hold when the interventions are chosen in a data-dependent way. In contrast, our data are observational, as we never change the treatment assignment and only change which covariates we observe; therefore, our observations remain independent and do not require the techniques in Kato et al. 2020. However, the ADR estimator from Kato et al. 2020 opens up a very interesting question: how can we select the best estimator when we may also intervene?\n\nMore generally, your question suggests an important future direction: establishing confidence bounds on cross-fitted estimators. Such results would have many applications beyond our setting. We will add a discussion in the paper.\n\nThe work of Howard et al. 2019 was considered extensively in our work. Specifically, the confidence sequence construction that we used is based on that work, and lemmas from that work are essential in deriving our Corollary 1. The error decomposition used to prove Theorem 1 was chosen specifically to allow all the random variables to be bounded by confidence sequences rather than confidence intervals. \n\n__Application__\n\nYour feedback here is helpful. We should have made it clearer that our contribution was intended to be entirely in the field of causal inference, rather than in the field of bandits. Specifically, our contributions can be summarized as follows.\n\nFirst, we wanted to overcome the following three current limitations of the causal inference literature on selection of identification formulas based on asymptotic variance:\n- Inability to select the best identification formula in some latent variables cases. As a concrete example, the DAG $Z_1\\rightarrow Z_2 \\leftarrow Z_3\\rightarrow Y$, $Z_1\\rightarrow A\\rightarrow Y$  admits the following adjustment sets: $\\emptyset$, $\\\\{Z_1\\\\}$, $\\\\{Z_3\\\\}$, $\\\\{Z_1, Z_2\\\\}$,$\\\\{Z_1, Z_3\\\\}$, $\\\\{Z_2, Z_3\\\\}$, and $\\\\{Z_1, Z_2, Z_3\\\\}$. According to Theorem 5 in the Appendix, the set $\\\\{Z_3\\\\}$ has the lowest asymptotic variance. If, however, $Z_3$ is latent, then either $\\\\{Z_1, Z_2\\\\}$ or $\\emptyset$ has the lowest variance depending on the model distribution, and therefore graphical criteria are unable to return the adjustment set with smallest variance. Our algorithm would be able to resolve this case.\n- Applicability to adjustment criteria only.\n- Inability to account for the costs of observing covariates.\n\nIn addition, we wanted to consider an adaptive covariate measurement (ACM) setting, namely a setting where one can choose which covariates to measure adaptively and wishes to identify the best formula as efficiently as possible. This ACM setting is a sequential decision making problem: modelling this problem as a bandit problem  enables us to use powerful bandit algorithms.\n\nThe ACM setting might be relevant to several applications where causal inference can play an important role, such as medical applications or advertising. Consider, for example, the question of which estimator we should use for a large clinical trial. The trial has the option of using several different estimators and, before the trial begins, we wish to identify, using a group of individuals, the estimator with the best long-run behavior, i.e. with the lowest cost-adjusted asymptotic variance. One approach would be to assign an estimator to each individual randomly, collect the covariates required by the estimator, and then estimate the estimator\u2019s asymptotic variance. However, using a bandit algorithm to assign an estimator to the $i$th individual based on the feedback from the individuals $k$ for $j<i$ would have the advantage of requiring a smaller group of individuals.\n\nThe problem of selection of identification formulas based on asymptotic variance has only started to receive some attention and is still at its infancy. Before the recently established graphical criteria, the set of parents or the smallest set of covariates was often used as adjustment sets, which is often inefficient. Whilst representing a huge advancement, graphical criteria have some limitations. Our idea of framing this problem as a best-arm-identification bandit problem is simple, yet effectively addresses many of the current issues. We also believe that our work may serve as a first step for solving more general problems.\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful review. We were pleased that you found our work to be novel and clearly exposed.\n\n__Clarity__\n\nThanks for pointing out that the paper would benefit from more background knowledge on bandit theory. We will add an overview on algorithms for best-arm-identification as well as more details about the LUCB and SE algorithms. \n\n__Significance__\n\n\nWe agree that there is no algorithmic contribution, as both bandit algorithms are trivial to extend to the confidence sequence case. However, in our opinion Theorem 1 represents a solid technical contribution. We realized that we did not sufficiently highlight and explain its significance in the submission. We attempt to do this below (we will incorporate the explanation also in the paper).\nTheorem 1 implies that having an uncentered influence function is a sufficient condition for obtaining the second-order dependence on the rate of nuisance function estimation. Neyman orthogonality, while sufficient for predicting the causal contrast at a parametric rate, is not sufficient for predicting the variance at the parametric rate. The proof of Theorem 1 is indeed straightforward under the condition of having an uncentered influence function, but a second-order result is generally not possible without this condition; most of the challenge was in identifying it.\nAnother key observation made during the proof of Theorem 1 was that the error admits the following two decompositions: \n1) A decomposition that would require to control $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\psi(w_i, \\hat\\eta_n)$ for all sequences of estimators $\\hat\\eta_n$ of $\\eta$.\n2) A decomposition that would only require a confidence sequence for $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\psi(w_i, \\eta)$, i.e. at the true $\\eta$, albeit with a few more details in the analysis.\n\nUsing the second decomposition allowed us to generalize all our results from confidence intervals to confidence sequences because we only needed to control the deviations at $\\eta$.\n\n__Other comments__\n\n- _Typos_: \nThanks for finding these! \nThere is a transpose missing as $\\lambda$ is a vector. \n$\\psi$ characterizes how quickly the tails of the distribution of the increments decay; for example, if $\\psi$ is a quadratic, then the tails of the distribution decay like a Gaussian. \nThe notation of Lemma 5 means that equation (2) is satisfied with $\\psi(\\lambda, V) = \\sigma^2 \\lambda^\\top V \\lambda /2$; we\u2019ll make sure to define this.\n\n- _Experiments_:\nWe were unable to think of better baselines for comparison, and are not sure what graph-structured-based algorithms you are referring to. We would appreciate it if you could point out some references.\n\n- _The influence function_:\nThe influence function is a property of the estimator and does not explicitly depend on the graph structure or the models for the nuisance function. In particular, the influence function for every adjustment criterion in the Experiments Section (which all use the AIPW estimator) are identical, even though the observed variables, unobserved variables, and nuisance function models may change for each adjustment set. Knowledge of the causal graph is only needed to obtain the adjustment sets (i.e. set of variables that block all non-causal paths and are non descendants of nodes on causal paths from $X$ to $Y$). For a concrete example, consider the DAG in the Experiments Section but now assume that $Z_1$ is latent. If we remove all the adjustment sets containing $Z_1$, we can simply run our bandit algorithms on the remaining estimators and learn the optimal estimator in the presence of a latent variable; we emphasize that every adjustment criterion estimator will still have the same influence function.\n\n- _Regret minimization_:\nAs you pointed out, it is straightforward to use confidence sequences with regret-minimizing algorithms (e.g. UCB). We opted for best-arm-identification because it seemed more natural for our setting: we want to have a high probability guarantee on finding the best estimator. In contrast, it is difficult to see how a small cumulative regret on sums of estimated asymptotic variances relates to our ability to estimate the causal contrast. The feedback we receive (an updated estimate of the asymptotic variance) from trying an estimator is also not easily interpreted as a loss, as there is a very strong dependence between successive rounds. However, there is a natural cumulative regret question in this setting: can you adaptively select which covariates to observe in a way that allows you to learn the causal contrast almost as well as the best covariate observation distribution in hindsight? This problem is substantially harder, as it requires general methods for combining estimates from different estimators with finite-sample confidence bounds.\n",

    "review": "This paper obtains improved approximation algorithms for a number of stochastic matching problems. These problems are motivated from many applications in AI, such as ride hailing, online ads and crowdsourcing. \n\nThe most basic problem is the following. There is a weighted graph where each edge e is active with independent probability p_e. The set of active edges is initially unknown. An algorithm can \u201cprobe\u201d edges sequentially: if an edge is probed and active then it must be included in the matching. There is also a \u201cpatience\u201d constraint that at most t_v edges at node v can be probed. The goal is to maximize the expected weight of the matching. The paper gives a 0.38 approximation for this problem, improving on a 0.31 result (and many previous ones). The main idea is in identifying the correct \u201cattenuation probabilities\u201d in the previous algorithm [Baveja et al.]. Both the algorithm and analysis rely heavily on [Baveja et al.]. They also use the idea from [Adamczyk et al.] for damping the LP probabilities. However, they view this process more abstractly, by searching for an \u201cattenuation function\u201d with certain properties. This seems like a cleaner approach than ad-hoc choices of the damping factor. For a particular attenuation function, they show (numerically) that the approximation is 0.38. Is this the \u201cbest\u201d attenuation function, or can one get a better bound with a different function? \n\nAn advantage of their approach (and some previous papers) is that the probing order is just random and not chosen in a careful manner. So the results also hold in the \u201crandom order\u201d online setting. They also obtain some improvements for problems in this setting. \n\nFor bipartite graphs with unit-patience on one side, they get a much better 0.63 approximation. This special case was recently studied in [Hikima et al.] where a 0.33 approximation was obtained. The authors mention that their improved result also implies an improvement in the final result of [Hikima et al.]. This seems like a significant improvement for that problem- but, there are no details given.  \n---\nI'm satisfied that the authors' result improves on the main result in [Hikima et al.]. It will be good to add full details in a later version.",
    "comment": "Thank you for taking the time to read our paper and write a detailed review. Regarding whether better attenuation functions are possible, our broad set of properties produces the best-possible attenuation functions for the analytical techniques we employ.  That is, our analysis identifies a worst-case graph structure (for the neighborhood of a single edge) which suggests that our attenuation functions are optimal given our analysis.  It is plausible to us that ideas such as analyzing randomized attenuation functions could lead to improved guarantees, which would make the \u201cworst case\u201d more mild; however, identifying such a worst case for a randomized attenuation function appears challenging, and hence we leave it outside the scope of our work.\n\nRegarding the improvement to the result of Hikima et al., this follows from the fact that our (1-1/e)-approximation improves the approximation of \u201cProblem A\u201d used in the proof of Theorem 1 in that paper. Our new proof achieving the (1-1/e)-approximation then replaces Lemma A of Hikima et al., improving the approximation ratio for Problem A from \u2153 to 1-1/e. This improved ratio carries through to the rest of their analysis, so that the \u2153 bound in Theorem 1 becomes 1-1/e, and so the solution to the problem they label (PA) is an (1-1/e)-approximation for their main problem (ISPCB). We apologize for the lack of justification and would be happy to add this explanation to the paper.",

The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms these methods in most cases, particularly in high-dimensional data sets.\n\nOne strength of the proposed algorithm is its ability to handle outliers and noise in the data. The authors use a robust distance metric that is resistant to outliers and noise, which allows the algorithm to identify meaningful clusters even in the presence of noise.\n\nHowever, the proposed algorithm also has some limitations. For example, it can be computationally expensive for very large data sets and may not be able to handle data sets with very high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe authors also discuss the potential applications of the proposed algorithm in real-world domains, such as image and text classification.

    "review": "Previous work proposed the natural approach of solving a fractional + in-expectation LP relaxation, and then sequentially probing the edges (in random order) with probabilities obtained from the LP solution. The goal of the analysis is to bound the minimum probability that any edge is probed, compared to its probability in the LP solution (which is an upper bound on the integral but offline optimum).\n\nThe authors of the new submission notice that this solution unfairly discriminates low-probability edges: out of k edges w.p. 1/k, we only have probability 1-1/e of picking one of them. In contrast a single edge with probability 1 (which appears identical to the LP) will be picked w.p. 1. This creates a bottleneck in the analysis when low and high probability edges are competing for matching the same vertex. To overcome this issue, the authors propose to weigh down high-probability edges, yielding improved constant factors in the competitive analysis. \n\n\n\nI think that this work will be quite interesting, but to a small crowd of specialized experts. \n",
    "comment": "Thank you for taking the time to read our paper and write a detailed review. We would like to briefly highlight that our paper, despite being largely theoretical, is relevant to several aspects of AI. In particular, our guarantees, which are possible for stochastic matching when the edge probabilities are known, illustrates the value of learning distributions, a cornerstone of modern AI. Additionally, online matching problems are common in deployed AI in a variety of application areas related to our work, such as kidney exchange, online dating, ad allocation, ride sharing, and worker-task crowdsourcing (the last two of which are studied in Hikima et al., 2021). Finally, the importance of worst-case bounds for online matching problems is discussed in several recent NeurIPS papers, with examples being \u201cBi-Objective Online Matching and Submodular Allocations\u201d (2016) and \u201cSecretary and Online Matching Problems with Machine Learned Advice\u201d (2020).

For many problems, adversarial arrival order can often present a strong challenge, and is sometimes even intractable. For instance, it is known that no constant competitive ratio is possible for online bipartite matching with edge weights, under adversarial vertex arrivals (see the survey \u201cOnline matching and ad allocation\u201d by Mehta, 2013); this justifies our assumption that the edges can be considered in a random or chosen order. Gaps between random and chosen order are not so severe, and ours is not the only problem for which the best chosen-order algorithm is also the best random-order one (see, e.g.,  https://www.sigecom.org/exchanges/volume_17/1/CORREA.pdf, where the best result for the classical prophet-inequality problem when the order can be chosen by the algorithm is achieved by an algorithm that uses a random order and hence also applies to the random-order prophet secretary problem).",

    "comment": "Thank you for taking the time to review our paper in detail. \n\nRegarding relevance to NeurIPS: Our guarantees, which are possible for stochastic matching when the edge probabilities are known, illustrates the value of learning distributions, a cornerstone of modern AI. Additionally, online matching problems are common in deployed AI in a variety of application areas related to our work, such as kidney exchange, online dating, ad allocation, ride sharing, and worker-task crowdsourcing (the last two of which are studied in Hikima et al., 2021). Finally, the importance of worst-case bounds for online matching problems is discussed in several recent NeurIPS papers, with examples being \u201cBi-Objective Online Matching and Submodular Allocations\u201d (2016) and \u201cSecretary and Online Matching Problems with Machine Learned Advice\u201d (2020).  We acknowledge that our section motivating the problems in AI is a bit brief, and are happy to add more details and cite further papers, including the ones above, in a revised version.\n\nRegarding your question about why we provide a family of attenuation functions: indeed, a single concrete function is sufficient to get our theoretical approximation results, and we give a few examples in Definition 4.  However, we write our proof based on an abstract function that satisfies our \u201ceffectiveness\u201d properties in Definition 3 because it helps to highlight the extent and limitations of our analysis. That is, one may be tempted to ask \u201cwhat other attenuation functions might work, and which ones might even give better results?\u201d Our more-abstract characterization suggests that our analysis will give the same result for many different functions (any function satisfying the given properties will achieve the same bound, using our analysis), thus suggesting that getting an even-better approximation ratio will likely require an attenuation function with even stronger properties along with a new analysis. More practically, the 0.38 factor refers to the worst-case scenario; real-world data may perform much better on average, and the real-world performance may vary with different attenuation functions. This means that different application domains may be better served in practice by different attenuation functions, and that our result can be applied to conclude that even functions tailor-made to a specific application can achieve the same theoretical guarantees provided they satisfy the given properties.\n\nRegarding the (1-1/e)-approximation, we have two such results (one simply states that our 0.38-approximation algorithm achieves an improved approximation in the case of star graphs with infinite patience, while the other is a new scheme for bipartite graphs). For a discussion on what our new scheme for bipartite graphs (with a unit-patience side) is able to establish beyond Lee and Singla (2018), please see our explanation under \u201cWhy we cannot use an existing Contention Resolution Scheme\u201d on page 9.  Certainly the Lee and Singla result is more general in that it applies to all matroids, but to the best of our knowledge, our scheme is needed when negative correlations are present.\n\nRegarding integrality gaps for the fractional LP we use, there is an upper bound in \u201cFollow your star: New frameworks for online stochastic matching with known and unknown patience\u201d (AISTATS, 2021) which shows that the expected size of the offline maximum matching in a general graph can be as small as 0.544 times the objective value of a specific LP.  Therefore, any actual probing algorithm cannot hope to have a guarantee better than 0.544 when analyzed against that LP.  To our knowledge, there are no tighter upper bounds known for a sequential probing algorithm, although that is an interesting question.  We will be sure to add these points to our paper. We also note that gaps for these problems are not exactly \u201cintegrality gaps\u201d since fractional solutions representing probing probabilities can be allowed. The aforementioned 0.544 example is called a stochasticity gap.\n",

    "comment": "We thank you for your positive feedback regarding our problem, clarity, and sound analysis.\n\n**Narrow Scope of the Experiments**\n\nText-based and decision-tree based policy explanations are two common types of explanations. A large number of frameworks can generate decision trees and text-based descriptions from a policy. Other explanations such as image-based (colormap), NLP-generated, and adaptive may prove useful in future work. We hope that our paper provides initial guiding principles in the design of future xAI techniques and motivates further studies with different types of explanations.\n\n**Suboptimal Agent Policy**\n\nPolicy explanations when the cobot is suboptimal (where the policy explanation is accurate while policy itself is suboptimal) is beyond the scope of this paper. We pose this as an interesting future direction. Prior work (Zhang et al) has presented some insight into suboptimal AI models for recommender systems in healthcare, finding that suboptimality reduces the trust in the AI.\n\nZhang, Zhan et al. \u201cEffect of AI Explanations on Human Perceptions of Patient-Facing AI-Powered Healthcare Systems.\u201d Journal of Medical Systems 45 (2021): n. pag.\n",

    "comment": "We thank you for your feedback regarding our clarity and reproducibility.\n\n**Related Work**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing us to related work that look at xAI in human-robot teaming. We provide a general description of our novelty with respect to the references you have suggested.\n\nHere, we describe the related work and find that our work is novel with respect to each, providing a valuable contribution to xAI in human-robot teaming literature. Lai et al., Bansal et al., Gonzalez et al., Bussone et al., Zhang et al., and Zhang et al. provide interesting findings relating explanation type and accuracy to trust and reliance in human-AI teaming with explanations. However, while Lai et al., Bansal et al., Bussone et al., Zhang et al., Gonzalez et al., and Zhang et al. deploy xAI-based support in classification problems (utilizing the AI as a transparent recommender system), the task is widely different from our scenario, a complex sequential decision-making problem where the AI is a collaborative agent that actively shapes the world. Anderson et al. provides interesting insight into how different explanations relate to mental model generation in a real-time strategy game. We expand on this by first relating xAI techniques to situational awareness, grounding it in a concept highly important in human-machine teaming. Furthermore, our experiment also provides human teammates with the complete cobot policy in the form of an interpretable decision tree, a type of explanation that is not among the referenced works. Finally, our experiment differs from Anderson et al. in that we assess performance among the human-cobot team with online explanations (Study 2). In this way, users must build mental models online while collaborating with the cobot.  \n\n**Further suggestions beyond clarifying the work for novelty, would be to describe how the same type of approach or study style could apply to other RL applications.**\n\nWe will add details to how our study style can be quickly generalized to other explanation types and/or other RL applications. We plan to release a detailed codebase so that others can reproduce our experiment and make changes to the policy and explanation type in future work.\n\n",

    "review": "**Overall:**\n\nThis paper is well-written and clear. The experiments are well-designed and the metrics capture the outcomes of interest. The experiment task itself, collaboratively building a house in Minecraft, is an interesting and non-trivial task. I also appreciate that the human-robot collaboration is unstructured, in that the human is free to choose the extent to which they collaborate with the robot; this makes the studies more ecologically valid.\n\nThe results of the study on time completion are surprising and useful: experts perform the task most efficiently with no robot explanations at all, and novices perform best with simple robot explanations (i.e., text) rather than more detailed explanations (i.e., decision trees). This surprising result is of potential interest to the human-robot interaction community.\n\nThe main limitation of the work is that the policy is hand-crafted and very simple: a high-level and low-level policy, each of which is a two-level binary decision tree with a total of four leaf nodes. It is unclear whether the results of this study could be generalized for more complex policies and explanations, that cannot be summarized so concisely.\n\nI am also not sure whether this work is a good fit for NeurIPS, given that there is no algorithmic contribution. I think this would be a strong submission for HRI, since the main contribution is the user studies.\n\n**Novelty:**\n\nThe main novelty of this work is its thorough investigation of the utility of explainable AI for human-machine collaboration, in the form of two user studies on a non-trivial collaboration task in Minecraft. There is no algorithmic or theoretical novelty.\n\n**Quality:**\n\nThe experiments are well-designed.

    "comment": "\nWe thank you for your feedback regarding our studies, experiment domain, and structure of collaboration.\n\n**Impact of Increased Size/Complexity Explanations**\n\nWe did not explicitly vary the explanation size (depth of the decision tree/specificity of cobot status) in our experiment and will note this as a limitation. Through pilot studies, we augmented the cobot\u2019s behavior and the resulting decision tree size so as to balance the needs to minimize the amount of time participants would need to spend to understand and utilize the tree vs. maximize the ability of the cobot to adapt to and collaborate with the participants. Increasing the size/complexity of xAI-based support and accordingly modifying the training time is an important future direction to explore, as there is a tradeoff between the utility of xAI-based support.\n\n**Not a good fit for NeurIPS**\n\nWhile our paper does not provide an algorithmic contribution, we believe our paper is a good fit for NeurIPS as it brings to light several interesting findings that can inform the design of future xAI techniques that may be used for support in human-machine teaming. Quoting Professor Michael Carbin from the Charles Isbell\u2019s NeurIPS 2020 keynote, \u201cThe issue is not just correctness, but understanding the problem across the entire pipeline to understand what correctness is.\u201d\n\n**Were the status and decision-tree explanations for both the high and low level, or just for the low level?**\n\nStudy 1 utilized both the high-level and low-level in its policy explanations.\n\n**In Figures 3b and 3c, it would be good to state what the performance residuals are with respect to. I assume it\u2019s with respect to the no-explanation condition.**\n\nWe will clarify this within our paper. The performance residuals are with respect to the no-explanation condition.\n\n",

    "review": "Related work\n============\n\nDespite the claim in the paper, there is a bit of work looking at XAI in human-robot teaming; although it is not directly called this. Some articles I know of:\n\n- Some of Tatagatha Chakraborti's work looks at explanation and explicability for cobots -- there are a number of papers, and some of the tasks are collaborative.\n\n- Neerincx et al. Using perceptual and cognitive explanations for enhanced human-agent team performance. In International Conference on Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics (pp. 204-214). Springer, Cham., 2018 -- this paper looks to build collaborative teaming \n\n- Madumal et al. Explainable reinforcement learning through a causal lens. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (Vol. 34, No. 03, pp. 2493-2500), 2020 -- this paper does evaluations with collaborative tasks.\n\nFurther, the `status explanation' appears to be the same as the idea of communicating intent. If the leaf nodes of the decision trees are explained, then this is simply explaining what the robot will do next. This has been studied in prior work in human-agent teaming; e.g., there are the articles that I know of, presumably there are others:\n\n- Harbers et al.: Explanation and coordination in humanagent teams: a study in the BW4T testbed. In Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology, pages 17\u201320. IEEE Computer Society, 2011.\n\n- Harbers et al. Explanation in human-agent teamwork. In Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, and Norms in Agent System VII, pages 21\u201337. Springer, 2012.\n\n- Li et al. Communication in human-agent teams for tasks with joint action. In International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, and Norms in Agent Systems (pp. 224-241).

In Proceedings of the 2020 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (pp. 329-341), 2020.\n\n\nNone of these touch on the same issues outlined in the paper, but they are perhaps more closely related than other references in the related work section.\n\nStudies\n=======\n\nThe studies using Malmo and the tasks are excellent. The task itself is reasonably rich and do run an interactive colalborative task is difficult to setup. This is the type of evaluation I'd love to see more of, and would love to do more of. I hope the authors share the setup and code for this once this paper is published. The actual policies are reasonably simple; perhaps simpler than anything I've seen in a truly collaborative task, but I do understand the limitations of working with participants recruited for studies and the time limits for training etc.\n\nThe study is well designed and separating studies between situation awareness and effects of SA effectively is a sound decision.\n\nThe major concern about the study is the data analysis. I *think* the analysis of the expert vs novice is unsound. The issue is that the split of the data into two sets is done on the same data that is used to analyse the results; that is, the performance of the participants is used to split the two cohorts, but then the performance is what is used to measure effectiveness of SA on the different conditions. This is circular analysis (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_analysis) and is not valid. As such, the results on the split between novice and expert are not valid and should be removed. If, on the other hand, the expert vs novice was measured in some other way (e.g. number of hours played on a particular server previously), then this split would be fine.\n\nSome comments/questions:\n\n- Did you validate the 20 hours Minecraft minimum? Or is this just self-rated? If you did, it would be great to explain how you did this (always a challenge for researchers!)\n\n- The two polic-information levels in the 2nd study are interesting. Is there a reason you didn't do this in the first study? (Not a criticism, just a question).\n\n- It would be good to get some idea of what the different surveys (mentioned at the bottom of page 7) and why they are important/useful. In particular, one page 8 (under Q2), there is a link between \"teaming ability\" and build speed. What is the teaming ability? Is this the measures from these surveys?\n\n- It would be great if the results from Q2 (including subject findings) could be graphed if possible.\n\n- How was trust measured (Q3). I assume this is perceived trust measured via a survey/questionnire? I couldn't find any details about this.\n\nSome minor typos, etc:\n\n- page 5: \"find-tuned\" --> \"fine-tuned\"\n\n- page 6 and beyond: the use pf \"p < 0.05\" and similar -- a lot of people (including me) really like to see the p-values themselves, rather than just significant or not significant. I realise you also do \"p < 0.001\" (which is probably fine), but really a p=0.049 and p=0.051 are almost the same result and the arbitrary boundary of 0.05 is not so important.\n\n- page 9: \"HMT\" is used for the first time and is not introduced. \n",
    "comment": "We thank you for your feedback regarding our studies and experiment domain. We plan to release a detailed codebase so that others can reproduce our experiment and make changes to the policy and explanation type in future work.\n\n**Related Work**\n\nWe thank you for pointing us to several related works that look at xAI in human-robot teaming and intent communication. We have updated our pdf to include the citations you have mentioned.\n\nWe note that the status explanation is different that the idea of communicating intent. Intent communication typically allows users to project cobot behavior into the future, allowing them to modify their own behavior accordingly to maximize performance. Study 1 (Section 4) finds that the status xAI-based does not support the projection of AI behavior, limiting the user to only perceive and comprehend the agent\u2019s current decision-making.\n\n**Unsound Data Analysis**\n\nWe did not conduct a circular analysis. The split between the novice and expert is not conducted on the same data. Our process was as follows (described in Section 5.3): \n1.\tWe split our data using a performance metric on a pre-test calibration task in which the subject works without the cobot to assess/baseline performance (individual task completion times). (Section 5.2, Line 284)\n2.\tOn the (separate) test task (completing the build while collaborating with the cobot), we measured performance again. (Section 3.1, Line 147)\n3.\tWe sought to see whether performance on the test task differed as a function of the split on the calibration task and find significance ($F(1,26)=23.5; p<0.001$). (Section 5.3, Line 309)\n\nAs such, our analysis was not circular.\n\n**Did you validate the 20 hours Minecraft minimum? Or is this just self-rated? If you did, it would be great to explain how you did this (always a challenge for researchers!)**\n\nWe validate user\u2019s proficiency in Minecraft in two stages. The first is self-rated where the users confirm that they have 20 hours of experience in Minecraft. The second is through a timed hand-crafted tutorial level in Minecraft where participants practice collecting resources, crafting, and placing objects, each a key element within the human-machine teaming task. Per our IRB Protocol, we have a dismissal criteria for the tutorial level to ensure that participants have sufficient knowledge of the game of Minecraft. If participants take longer than ten minutes within the tutorial level, it is deemed they do not have basic knowledge of Minecraft, including understanding the controls, placing and crafting objects in the game, etc. and are dismissed from the experimentation with a pro-rated compensation.\n",
