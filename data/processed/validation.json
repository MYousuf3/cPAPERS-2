    "comment": "Thank you for taking the time to review the paper write these comments! Some of them are very helpful to improve the manuscript\u2019s readability. Thank you for being candid about your level of experience with this literature and problem setup. We hope your comments and concerns are well addressed below. If there are any remaining doubts or points of unclarity, please kindly let us know.\n\nQ1: \u201cline 41/43/84: It is unclear that \"\\epsilon is a vector of independent noise variables\", \"\\epsilon_i are uncorrelated within each domain, ...\", and \"\\epsilon_i are not necessarily mutually independent...\"\nIn the linear structural equation models (SEM) settings, is independence of \\epilson_i required? Otherwise it may violate the markov condition and it seems to be a mixture of directed and undirected graphical model.\u201d\n\nA1: In line 41, we give the general claim that the components of $\\epsilon$ are mutually independent in the first setting. In lines 42 and 43, we give the more specific conditions in the two settings we consider. In the second setting, $\\epsilon_i$ are uncorrelated (and hence independent if they are Gaussian) within each domain, but their variances may change dependently across domains. \n\nIn the second setting, the $\\epsilon_i$ may be dependent across domains (although we reiterate that they are uncorrelated within each domain). If this is the case, it may be desirable to introduce some high-level background variables explaining why the error variances are dependent across domain. Hence, the Markov condition is not violated. We do not try to model those higher level variables; we focus on the linear causal relations among X and L to explain the measured data.\n\nQ2: \u201cline 55: definition of the directed path says that (V_i) is a directed path from V_i to itself. Then, Pa(V_i) should include V_i.\u201d \nA2: Here we just follow the definitions for Pa(V_i) and path given in standard textbooks like Spirtes et al. [1] or Pearl [2]. The definition of path implies that (V_i) is always a directed path from V_i to itself.\n\nQ3: \u201cline 91, the conditions in Theorem 1 is not clear. It should clarify that \"Suppose we have observed X generated according to the mixing procedure (4) in a number of domains, t = 1, 2, T\"\nIf T =2, then is the considered model is X = Y M \\epsilon_1 + (1- Y) M \\epsilon_2 where Y is Bernoulli distribution with known/unknown probabilities?, X_j = \\beta X_{Pa(j)} + Y_{1j} \\epsilon_{j1} + (1 - Y_{1j}) \\epsilon_{j2} where (Y_{1j}) are independent Bernoulli distribution with known/unknown probabilities, or X = M (p \\epsilon_1 + (1- p) M \\epsilon_2)? In addition, in the finite sample setting, is it assumed to be known what distribution of error (\\epsilon_t) the sample follows?\u201c\n\nA3: Thank you for your suggestion. Note that in each domain, the data was generated according to the same mixing procedure as given in (4), but that the variances of the noise terms may change from domain to domain. In each domain, the data are not a mixture of multiple linear mixing procedures. \n\nWe respectfully fear there may have been some misunderstanding regarding the idea of heterogeneous domains. Theorem 1 assumes that the practitioner has access to multiple domains, and knows which samples came from which domain (but need not know anything about the error distribution). Specifically, the t-th domain consists of iid samples from $X = M_X \\epsilon_t$, where $\\epsilon_t$ is a vector of uncorrelated random errors. This interpretation is consistent with what is written at lines 34, lines 43-44, and 83-86.\n\nQ4: \u201cline 116, the definition of the bottleneck should be clarified when J and K are sets of nodes. \"We say that a set B is a bottleneck from J to K if every directed path from J to K includes some b \\in B.\" line 121 From the definition, for each Vi, Ch(Vi) is a bottleneck from Ch(Vi) to X.\nFirst of all, if J includes two nodes, saying J = {1, 2}, and K = {3}, the directed path from J to K is not defined. It is one of the key definitions to provide an important condition in this paper, it should be precisely defined.\ne.g., I at first conjecture that it means that the directed path from j to k, for all j \\in J and k \\in K. Then, all directed paths are (1,3), (2,3). Hence, {3} is only bottleneck. However, then, it is contradictory to line 121.\u201c\n\nA4: We will update the condition to avoid possible confusion: \u201cB is a bottleneck from J to K if for every $j \\in J$ and every $k \\in K$, every directed path from j to k includes some $b \\in B$.\u201d For example, if J = K = {1, 2}, then B is a bottleneck from J to K if and only if $\\{1, 2\\} \\subseteq B$. As this example shows, bottlenecks may include elements of J and/or K.\n\nThe second source of confusion indicates a trouble with the choice of terminology \u201cbottleneck.\u201d It might be preferable to understand the word \u201cbottleneck\u201d as something like \u201cbarricade\u201d throughout the paper, since \u201cbottleneck\u201d seems to have a misleading connotation. Please observe the distinction among bottleneck, minimal bottleneck, and unique minimal bottleneck given in lines 116-120. In your example, while it is true that {3} is a bottleneck from {1,2} to {3}, {1, 2} is also a bottleneck. Of course, {3} is the unique minimal bottleneck, but not the only possible bottleneck. Hence it is possible for $Ch(V_i)$ to be a bottleneck from $Ch(V_i)$ to X, and so we believe there is no contradiction. If you are unconvinced, please kindly let us know.\n\nQ5: \u201cline 160, it is also unclear that \"Rank(M_K^J) = 0 is a violation of classical faithfulness if there...\". It is in fact not true that without considering the error variances of (\\epsilon). The statement is true if all error variances are the same, otherwise there is no guarantees that \"there is a path from J to K but the path coefficients cancel out so that the net effect of J on K is 0\".\n\nA5: We have used \u201cclassical faithfulness\u201d in the standard sense of \u201cfaithfulness\u201d as defined in standard references like Spirtes et al. [1]. If $Rank(M^J_K) = 0$, then $M^J_K = 0$. Thus for every $j \\in J$ and every $k \\in K$, $V_k$ is marginally independent of $\\epsilon_j$, since $V_k = \\sum_{i=1}^p M^i_k \\epsilon_i = \\sum_{i \\not\\in J} M^i_k \\epsilon_i$. Hence classical faithfulness requires that there be no path from $\\epsilon_j$ to $V_k$; otherwise there would be an independence relation not encoded in the graph, thus violating faithfulness. Observing that $V_j$ is the only child of $\\epsilon_j$, faithfulness indeed requires that there be no path from $V_j$ to $V_k$.\n\nQ6: In addition, the term \"bottleneck faithfulness\" might better to be modified, because it is completely based on the graph, the original faithfulness assumption is based on the graph and its probability distribution. Hence, the name \"bottleneck faithfulness\" might lead to incorrect understanding of the concept of the bottleneck faithfulness.\u201d\n\nA6: Bottleneck faithfulness is not just based on the graph; it is a relationship between the graph and the specific rank (and thus properties of the distribution), as stated in lines 156-157. Similarly, classical faithfulness is a relationship between a graph and a distribution (in particular, conditional independence relations implied by the distribution). Both involve relationships between the graph and properties of the distribution.\n\nQ7: \u201cline 179, it should be clarified that \"Let V_k \\to V denote the variables whose longest path to X has fewer than k nodes.\" For example, 1->2->3<-4. Then, by the definition of V_k, we can see V_1 = {3}, V_2 = {2,3,4}, V_3 = {1,2,3,4}, while the longest path is 1->2->3. Hence, it should be the variables whose paths to X has fewer than k nodes.\u201d\n\nA7: Assuming that 3 is an observed variable, then your example is consistent with our definition. The natural language description at line 179 is intended to be a simple paraphrase of the formal definitions given in (9) and (10). In light of your comment, to avoid any potential misunderstanding, we can paraphrase: \u201cLet $V_k \\subseteq V$ denote the variables such that, for all $X_i \\in X$, no path from $V_k$ to $X_i$ has more than k nodes.\u201d (This is consistent with the formal definition in (9) and (10), which is used in the formal proof of Lemma 3.)\n\nQ8: \u201cFigure 4, it is unclear that how Desc(X_2) = Desc(L_1) in all graphs. For instance, in G_1, Desc(X_2) = (X_2, X_3) and L_1 does not exist.\u201d\n\nA8: Thanks for catching this. It should read: $Desc(L_2) \\cap \\mathcal{X} = Desc(X_1) \\cap \\mathcal{X}$. We will update this in the paper.\n\nQ9: \u201cline 285, it should be clarified that the expectation of the variable corresponding to a node is zero, somewhere in Section 2.\u201d\n\nA9: Thanks for pointing this out. By default we have centered the data, so that the mean is zero. We will make this explicit in the paper.",

This general framework would be new because those models have been investigated separately. \n\nThe estimation method based on exhaustive search in Section 3 looks a na\u00efve method. Another proposed estimation based on sparse regularization is proposed. The idea seems not so new. \n\nQuality: \nI\u2019m not sure if the assumption on the sparseness on lines 106-111 is reasonable or effective in which application domains. I wonder if there is a reasonable scientific reason to think that the sparsest models are the truth.\n\nFurther, I\u2019m interested in how the identifiability results change if the sparsest model assumption has been removed.

    "comment": "Thank you for your valuable and detailed comments!  We have collected them into three major remarks and seven minor questions. We are excited that the reviewer has hit on two major points that need a bit more motivation in the manuscript. If there are still doubts about these responses, please kindly let us know.\n\nQ1: \u201cThe proposed estimation methods look not very fresh or solid.\u201d\n\nA1: We agree that both of our estimation methods are standard: L1 regularization and BIC score. However, we see the main contribution of our paper as a theoretical one. Existing work on this problem has progressed inefficiently because it is generally not clear which partially observed structures are identifiable, and which are not. Hence a significant part of the process involves coming up with a type of identifiable graph, proving its identifiability, and then designing an efficient estimation algorithm. Our conditions will hopefully inspire researchers to jump straight to step three.\n\nWith that said, we have included experimental results of an exhaustive search method as a sort of proof of concept. It shows that with finite samples, we can reliably identify the true causal structure if and only if the causal structure satisfies the bottleneck condition, strong non-redundancy, and bottleneck faithfulness. This serves as a sanity check for our identification theory, and also gives us some idea what the sample complexity looks like. We have further included our discouraging results from the L1 method to caution practitioners against such a simple but flawed approach, and to show readers that the estimation problem remains open. We do not advocate its application as an estimation method, but hope for more advanced estimation methods in light of our theoretical results.\n\nQ2: \u201cFurther, I\u2019m interested in how the identifiability results change if the sparsest model assumption has been removed. I thought previous works [17-22] do not make this assumption.\u201d\n\nA2: Thank you for this interesting question. We believe that references [19-22] actually do assume minimality implicitly; that Salehkaleybar et al. [18] is only solving a subset of our problem (and therefore has no need to assume minimality); and that Hoyer et al. [17] take an even less plausible primitive than minimality: namely, that no two latent variables are adjacent (more precisely, they translate graphs with latent-latent interactions into \u201ccanonical models\u201d with no latent-latent interactions, and then learn these false graphs).\n\nEach of reference [19, 20, 21, 22] assumes that each latent variable has at least four [19], three [20], or two [21, 22] pure observed children (observed variables which have no other parents). As we mention at lines 234-239, these assumptions are strictly stronger than our bottleneck and non-redundancy conditions. [The proof is straightforward: Non-redundancy clearly holds because for every $L_i$ and $L_j$, $L_i$ has at least two children that $L_j$ does not. The bottleneck condition clearly holds because if, for some $L_i$, some latent child $L_j$ is not included in a bottleneck from $Ch(L_i)$ to X, then $L_j$\u2019s two (or more) pure children would have to be included.] Since these two conditions along with bottleneck faithfulness (which, as we have shown in supplement section 1.3, is generally applicable) are sufficient to prove that the graph is uniquely minimal (see Theorem 3 and the definition of \u201cidentifiable up to trivialities\u201d at 109-111) it follows that references [19, 20, 21, 22] all assume conditions strictly stronger than minimality.\n\nIn particular, none of references [19, 20, 21, 22] can identify the structures in Figures 2, Figure 4, and (more generally) any structure where no latent variable has any pure children. However, we can identify any graph that those papers can. \n\nWhile Salehkaleybar et al. [18] do not assume minimality, they are only trying to solve a part of the problem that we are. As we remark in line 229, they want to identify the net effect of each observed variable on every other observed variable. Answering that question does not require the them to single out any particular latent structure.\nAs stated in line 225, the discussion of \u201ccanonical models\u201d in Hoyer et al. [17] can be seen as a way of translating models which violate our bottleneck condition (and are therefore not uniquely minimal) into models which do satisfy our bottleneck condition. These \"canonical models\" assume that the latent variables are mutually independent (and accordingly, not causally adjacent). In other words, they don't try to learn causal graphs with causally adjacent latent variables; they take as primitive that the latent variables are nonadjacent. But we try to go further; we study the identifiability of causal models with causally adjacent latent variables. So we need to take a different primitive: a particular type of minimality.\n\nQ3: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the assumption on the sparseness on lines 106-111 is reasonable or effective in which application domains. I wonder if there is a reasonable scientific reason to think that the sparsest models are the truth.\u201d\n\nA3: Thank you for raising this concern. First, let\u2019s summarize the logical structure of the argument appearing in the paper. For any partially observed causal structure, it is always possible to construct a denser model which yields the same distribution, as we indicate in lines 100-101. This is a huge equivalence class; if we are to even talk about identification theory for partially observed causal models, we need a way to move beyond this huge equivalence class. This motivates us at in lines 106-111 to chose the simplest model in the sense that we select from this class the graph or graphs with the smallest number of edges. In this sense, we don\u2019t assume minimality so much as we take it as an foundational principle: roughly speaking (see lines 109-111) to be identifiable is to be minimal. The bottleneck, non-redundancy, and bottleneck faithfulness conditions provide an interpretable and (given the graph) testable characterization of the class of minimal graphs (which, as we have argued here and in lines 100-111, are exactly the identifiable graphs).\n\nVariants of this minimality principal are common throughout the causal discovery literature. In our response to Q2, we have argued that the assumptions of references [19-22] all have unique minimality as a logical consequence. But similar principles are widely adopted in causal discovery even in the causally sufficient case. For example, Forster et al. (2018) introduce a principle they call \u201cfrugality\u201d in the causally sufficient case, and argue that such a principle has several desirable properties. Raskutti and Uhler (2012) similarly propose a principle they call the \u201csparsest Markov representation\u201d assumption. More generally, from a model selection perspective, popular model selection criteria like BIC favor minimal graphs, as we show in our experiments.\n\nSeven Minor Questions:\n\nAlso, thanks for your seven minor questions. We will clarify these in the manuscript. Our clarifications:\n1) We should say, \u201cLet J, B, and K be subsets of nodes in a directed graph. Note that they need not be mutually disjoint.\u201d\n2-4) Thanks for catching these typos. \n5) it means \u201cthe number of trials (out of 10) that graph (i) was the best fitting,\u201d as indicated in the paragraph introducing these tables.\n6) Q: \u201cIn 6.1, were the artificial data generated under the assumption that the underlying model is the sparsest.\u201d\nA: We simulated data from both identifiable (and therefore \u201csparsest,\u201d or in the terminology of the paper, \u201cminimal\u201d) and non-identifiable (including both minimal and non-minimal) graphs. This is detailed in lines 290-313 of the main paper.\n7) Q: \u201cHow is the number of hidden variables selected?\u201d\nA: In the exhaustive search experiment, the BIC score naturally selects the number of hidden variables. As indicated in line 294, all graphs with 3 observed variables were enumerated in order from the sparsest to the densest, subject to the constraint that every latent have at least two neighbors (children or parents) and at least one observed descendant. (The constraint just ensures that every latent contributes to the model in some way.) For the L1 experiment, we simply used the true number of latents; the point is to show that the $L_1$ penalty is not effective, and that more sophisticated estimation procedures are needed. Such methods are complicated enough to require separate studies their own; thus we restrict this paper to identification theory and some stimulating proof of concept.\n\nReferences\nM. Forster, G.

    "comment": "Thank you for your encouraging comments! We are especially happy you agree that our identifiability conditions will facilitate future research on the problem. For example, we hope that our detailed analysis of the linear case will provide useful insights for future analysis of the non-linear case. Similarly, we believe our conditions will be especially useful in the development of estimation algorithms for partially observed linear systems. In existing work on this topic, quite a lot of effort is spent coming up with tractable special cases of identifiable partially observed causal structures, then proving such structures\u2019 identifiability, and finally developing an efficient estimation algorithm for such structures. We hope that our graphical conditions will streamline the this process in future research, allowing future works to skip straight to the estimation algorithm.\n\nMinor points: Thanks for pointing out that Theorem 1 is a sufficiency result, and not an if-and-only-if.

    "comment": "We are very grateful to the reviewer for the thoughtful comments and the time devoted to the paper. We have collected them into five main remarks, and addressed them below.\n\nQ1: \u201cDrawback is that it is hard to asses to what extent the accompanying assumptions apply in practice or whether they are very restrictive or not. Naturally \u2018linear\u2019 is often assumed but not always valid. Also the need to know the number of latents beforehand makes it harder to apply in real-world scenarios. Often the goal is to infer what latent variables / constructs can be recognised/identified from the observed distribution. Similarly, on applying the reconstruction estimation described in section 6, it is not easy to verify from the output obtained whether the assumptions actually did hold or not.\u201d\n\nA1: Thank you for this concern. We agree that linearity is often assumed but not always valid. The estimation of the number of latents can be cast as a model selection process. Regarding verifying from the output whether the assumptions actually hold, first, non-redundancy is actually local, and quite simple to check --  to check whether it holds between two variables $V_1$ and $V_2$, we only need to know $Ch(V_1)$ and $Ch(V_2)$. On the other hand, the bottleneck condition is relatively global. To check whether the bottleneck condition holds for $L_i$, we must inspect all directed paths from $L_i$ to X, because a minimal bottleneck may lurk arbitrarily far downstream from $L_i$ without compromising the identification of the rest of the graph. We will add an example illustrating this point to the manuscript.\n\nQ2: \u201cThese two assumptions are at first sight quite artificial and hard to parse in terms of what graphs are excluded and what not. In other words, it is not easy to see how restrictive / realistic these assumptions are in practice. It would be helpful to give some hints/pointers to see what types of graphs generally satisfy these conditions. For example if the variables can be separated so that there are no directed paths from X to L, does the causal structure between the X influence the \u2018unique minimal bottleneck condition\u2019?\u201d\n\nA2: Regarding intuition about the graphical conditions, Figures 1-3 present some simple motivations for the conditions, and Figures 5-6 of the supplement provide some simple examples of small graphs which are respectively identifiable and unidentifiable. Here, let us build intuition by providing some additional consequences of the conditions. For example: each variable must have fewer than $|X|$ children; each latent variable must have at least two children; if a variable has no latent children, then the bottleneck condition is satisfied trivially. We will include these in our manuscript. To answer your particular question, if there are no paths from X to L, then the causal graph among X has no impact on the bottleneck condition. (Proof: if B is a bottleneck from $Ch(V_i)$ to X, then on any path originating in $Ch(V_i)$ and terminating in X, the path must be blocked by B upon or before crossing the first observed node on the path. This fact is independent of that observed variable\u2019s children. Since this holds for any bottleneck, it holds in particular for the minimal bottleneck.) On the other hand, the causal graph among X is relevant for non-redundancy. To see why, please refer to Figure 6(iv-vi) of the supplement, and compare this to Figure 5(viii-xi) of the supplement. \n\nQ3: \u201cPerhaps the \u2018full identifiability\u2019 is more than what is actually needed\u201d.\n\nA3: This is a very good point, and it suggests two separate directions for future research. One is to leverage the identification theory of the present paper to find local causal structures which leave easily identified \u201ccausal signatures\u201d in the observed data, and which are themselves identifiable even if the graph taken as a whole is not. This is the direction taken by various existing works (including the classical Tetrad conditions). A second line of research could investigate identifiable \u201cversions\u201d of non-identifiable graphs. Such work would extend the \u201ccanonical models\u201d in Hoyer et al. [17], but informed by our necessary and sufficient conditions, could consider more sophisticated indeterminacies. By characterizing the relationship between unidentifiable and identifiable structures, this would expand the kinds of partially observed causal systems which can be approximately estimated and studied.\n\nQ4: \u201cp9.321-324: doesn\u2019t L1 typically induce sparsity by driving certain small coefficients to zero?\u201d\n\nA4: Thanks for this comment; we completely agree that L1 typically drives small coefficients to zero. Indeed, in our experiments, L1 does drive some small coefficients to zero. However, our objective function is also highly non-convex, which makes this behavior\u2019s relation to the penalization constant less predictable than in, say, linear regression. Thus we may find local minima that are slightly denser than the true system, but whose every non-zero entry is \u201cmedium\u201d sized: too large to prune, but still adding up to a relatively small total L1 penalty. This is discussed in further detail, together with an example, in the supplement (Section 2.3.).\n\nQ5: \u201cp3.93: \u2018uncorrelated in each domain\u2019 => does this mean they all\u00a0have\u00a0to change between domains? if so, then that is a rather strong and unrealistic setting, as in most cases only a subset of noise terms is likely to differ between domains\u201d\n\nA5: Thanks for raising this excellent point. In order to establish full identifiability of the underlying structure in the paper, we assume that the variances of all noise terms change between domains or over time. However, we completely agree that in practice perhaps only a subset of noise terms will ever change, with the rest staying constant. Establishing partial identifiability in this setting will be very interesting and extremely useful in practice, although it does not seem straightforward. We believe it will be a meaningful direction of future research.\n\nIn addition, thank you for catching various minor typos. We have corrected them in the manuscript.\n\n",

    "submission_title": "Even your Teacher Needs Guidance: Ground-Truth Targets Dampen Regularization Imposed by Self-Distillation",
    "review": "This paper provides closed-form solutions of self-distillation in the kernel ridge regression setting. Overall, the entire paper is mostly well-written and easy to follow. It is a natural extension of the theoretical results in Mobahi et al. (2020), though the theoretical novelty is limited given the prior works (the theorems are not hard to derive based on the results of Mobahi et al. (2020)). See detailed comments below.\n\n\n1. After reading the paper, I am not convinced that incorporating the ground-truth label is essential during the self-distillation step to overcome underfitting. As you show in Theorem 4.5, the weighting parameter $\\alpha$ turns out to amplify the regularization parameter $\\lambda$. In this sense, we can also smartly tune $\\lambda$ on the validation set to achieve the same effect as tuning $\\alpha$. Therefore, I don't think that incorporating the ground-truth labels of training data are necessary. \n\n\n2. The way to estimate the value of $\\alpha$ in section 4.3 is not globally optimal, as it does not account for the future steps of self-distillation. I would instead call it a greedy estimation of $\\alpha$.\n\n\n3. For  ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10, why are the best training accuracy only 88% and the best test accuracy only 94%? In my experience, the training accuracy can always reach very close to 100%, and the test accuracy is around ~94%. Please check out this GitHub: https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar. \n\n\n4. For Line 239-240, you mentioned that \"As illustrated in Figure 2a for case (a), the regularization imposed by self-distillation initially improves the quality of the solution\". To me, I don't see such a trend in Figure 2(a). The curves corresponding to $f_1, ..., f_{\\infty}$ become more underfitting as the index value increases. To better illustrate your argument, I would suggest the authors provide a figure of \"$\\tau$ vs. training loss\" (similar to Figure 5).\n\n\n5. It would be better to state the contribution in the introduction rather than in related works (Line 84-93). Also, the introductions to the notation (Line 96-101) are well-suited to be at the beginning of Section 3 Problem Setup.\n\n\n6. One minor correction to footnote 4, for some cases (e.g., using Adam optimizer), the equivalence between L2 regularization and weight decay does not hold. See Loshchilov et al.

    "comment": "We thank you for your rigorous reading and detailed feedback. We are happy that you found the paper well-written, and that it studies a critical problem. We appreciate the detailed comments and will adapt our paper for a final version - please see details below.\n\n1. *\"I am not convinced that incorporating the ground-truth label is essential during the self-distillation step to overcome underfitting.\"* and *\"We can also smartly tune $\\lambda$ on the validation set to achieve the same effect as tuning $\\alpha$.\"*\nConcerning the latter point, it is true that in the limit, our self-distillation procedure is equivalent to larger regularization, but for finite steps, the dynamics differ. Previous results have shown that often self-distillation does in fact improve performance after a few steps, and with varying effect of using the ground-truth. We show that although (in the limit) one could just set the regularization parameter higher, the behaviour of the solutions are different for finite steps. The different behaviour comes from the fact that increasing \u03bb would scale all the eigenvalues of the kernel by the same factor, but not change/sparsify the eigenvalues dynamically as self-distillation does. Hence, the interesting elements are in the steps between the infinite solutions and the initial, where the regularization parameter can not be scaled to obtain the same effect.\nFinally, for the limiting case, tuning $\\lambda$ is often performed with a grid search, and here we propose an alternative greedy approach using $\\alpha$, that can be carried out without a grid search as argued in Section 4.3 and 4.5.\nConcerning the need for ground-truth labels, we do not claim that incorporating the ground-truth label is necessary for self-distillation, but rather observe that it is often done in practice, and we provide some insights into the effect of doing so.\n2. The estimation is indeed greedy across multiple $\\tau$ (globally), but optimal for a single $\\tau$. We will change the naming and add a comment in a final version to emphasize this.\n3. The empirical experiments in our paper are constrained by the theoretical set-up and it appears reasonable to assume that this is the cause of the discrepancy in performance. Indeed, the empirical experiments on CIFAR-10 are done in a highly simple setting; e.g. only minor pre-processing and augmentations, as well as no learning rate schedule. Most importantly we minimize the MSE loss in (18), and not the more common cross-entropy loss. These differences combined likely causes the performance drop compared to experiments with cross-entropy loss, augmentations and learning rate schedules. We will add a comment about the differences in performance and setup in a final version, and if time and compute allows, we will repeat the empirical experiments with both the cross-entropy loss and a learning rate schedule (similarly to the provided link). Although we expect a performance improvement with these changes, we do not expect the overall finding of the effect of $\\alpha^{\\star(\\tau)}$ to be significantly different. \n4. Although subtly, the performance does in fact improve for the first few distillation steps. We will include a plot of $\\tau$ vs. loss for both the training and validation loss for the three examples: $\\alpha = 0$, $\\alpha = 0.25$ and $\\alpha^{\\star(\\tau)}$ illustrating this observation.\n5. We agree on these comments and will rearrange the subsections in a final version.\n6. Agree - we will emphasize this more clearly in a final version.\n\nOnce again, we thank you for the valuable feedback, and we hope that you will consider increasing your score.",

The derivation of the first equation to Theorem 1 and the equation between Eq. (18) and (19) could show the key difference between the sequential selection setting and traditional supervised learning setting.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:}$ Thank you for pointing out this. We will be happy to explain more about the first equation in the proof of theorem 1. \nLet $I_i=1$ be an event that individual $i$ at time slot $i$ is selected. Similarly, $I_i=0$ is an event that individual $i$ is not selected. Note that if an applicant is selected, the process stops.  We can write $\\Pr\\\\{E_a,\\tilde{Y}=1\\\\}$ as follows, \n$$\\Pr\\\\{E_a,\\tilde{Y}=1\\\\} = \\Pr\\\\{I_1= 1,A_1=a,Y_1=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{I_1=0,I_2= 1,A_2=a,Y_2=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{I_1=0,I_2=0,I_3=1,A_3 =a,Y_3 = 1\\\\}+ ...  $$\nSince $R_i$ is a binary predictor, individual $i$ is selected if $R_i=1$. It implies that, \n$$ \\Pr\\\\{E_a,\\tilde{Y}=1\\\\}=  \\Pr\\\\{R_1= 1,A_1=a,Y_1=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{R_1=0,R_2= 1,A_2=a,Y_2=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{R_1=0,R_2=0,R_3=1,A_3 =a,Y_3=1\\\\}+ .. $$ \nBecause $(R_i,A_i,Y_i)$ and $(R_j,A_j,Y_j)$ are i.i.d. random variables, we have, \n$$ \\Pr\\\\{E_a,\\tilde{Y}=1\\\\}=  \\Pr\\\\{R_1= 1,A_1=a,Y_1=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{R_1=0\\\\}\\Pr\\\\{R_2= 1,A_2=a,Y_2=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{R_1=0\\\\}\\Pr\\\\{R_2=0\\\\}\\Pr\\\\{R_3=1,A_3 =a,Y_3=1\\\\}+ .. $$\nNote that  $(R_i,A_i)$ and $(R_j,A_j)$ and $(R,A)$ have the same distribution. Therefore,\n$$ \\Pr\\\\{E_a,\\tilde{Y}=1\\\\}=  \\Pr\\\\{R= 1,A=a,Y=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{R=0\\\\}\\Pr\\\\{R= 1,A=a,Y=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{R=0\\\\}\\Pr\\\\{R=0\\\\}\\Pr\\\\{R_3=1,A_3 =a,Y=1\\\\}+ ... $$\nAs you can see, the above equation is a geometric series. We have, \n$$ \\Pr\\\\{E_a,\\tilde{Y}=1\\\\}= \\frac{\\Pr\\\\{R= 1,A=a,Y=1\\\\}}{1-\\Pr\\\\{R=0\\\\}}$$\n\nWe can have a similar argument for the equation between Eq. (18) and (19).\n\nWe will add this explanation to section A.1 and the proof of Theorem 1. We hope that the reviewer reconsiders his/her score because this issue is easily fixable. \n\n$\\textbf{Comment:}$ In the proof to Theorem 2, how the second constraint in Eq. (5) is used? I believe that it is hidden somewhere in the proof but the authors should explicitly show that.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:}$ Thank you for pointing this out. The second constraint in Eq. (5) has been used before line 557 to cancel out the denominators. We will improve the proof of theorem 2 in the final version. \n\n$\\textbf{Comment:}$ The paper defines accuracy as $\\Pr\\\\{\\tilde{Y}=1\\\\}$. But to me this is just the true positive rate, not the accuracy, since it only considers the case where the individual is predicted positive. Could the authors clarify this?\n\n\n$\\textbf{Response:}$ Thank you for pointing out this. Yes, we will clarify this in the final version. As we can see in the equation after line 189, $\\Pr\\\\{\\tilde{Y} =1 \\\\} = \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z=1\\\\}$ which is not the true positive rate. \n\n\n$\\textbf{Comment:}$  The logic of Sections 4.1 and 3.1 are not consistent. In Section 3.1, the paper defines a probability to flit the decision of the pre-trained model. But in Section 4.1, the paper \u201ctrust\u201d the score made by the pre-trained model and only aims to learn a threshold for making decisions.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:}$ We are sorry for the confusion. In both section 4.1 and section 3.1, the goal is to find a fair binary predictor.\nThe pre-trained model in section 3.1, is a binary classifier. Therefore, we have to flit the decision to satisfy the ESR notion.  However, in section 4.1, the pre-trained model is not a classifier. It is a score function in [0,1].  In order to find a fair binary predictor using a score function, the easiest way is to use two thresholds to map the score function to a binary decision. This does not mean that we trust the pre-trained model. This is because we need a binary decision. \n\nSince you mentioned \"trust\", it is important to say that the quality of predictor $R$ affects the performance of binary decision $Z$. If $R$ is not an informative score function, $Z$ will not be an accurate predictor. More specifically, The following theorem identifies the condition under which we can trust predictor $R$. We will add this theorem to the final version. \n\n$\\textsf{Theorem:}$ Let $Z^*$ be the optimal binary predictor that can be obtained using joint distribution of $(X,A,Y)$ through an in-processing method. Assume that  there exits $\\underline{\\tau}$ such that $\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} - \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|R\\geq \\tau\\\\} \\leq \\epsilon, \\forall \\tau>\\underline{\\tau}$. Let $Z$ be the predictor obtained using the optimal thresholds of optimization problem (13). Then, we have,\n$$|\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} - \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z=1\\\\}| \\leq \\epsilon$$\n\n$\\textsf{Proof sketch:}$ Note that based on our definition, we can show that $\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z=1\\\\}$ is the accuracy of binary predictor $Z$.\n\nWe prove this theorem by contradiction. Assume that $|\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} - \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z=1\\\\}| > \\epsilon$. \n\nConisider two thresholds $\\tilde{\\tau}_0$, $\\tilde{\\tau}_1$ such that $\\tilde{\\tau}_0 \\geq \\underline{\\tau}$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}_1\\geq \\underline{\\tau}$ and they are the feasible point of optimization problem (13) (wee can show that these two thresholds always exist). Let $\\tilde{Z}$ be the predictor obtained by thresholding $R$ using $\\tilde{\\tau}_0$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}_1$.\nSince   $\\tilde{\\tau}_0 \\geq \\underline{\\tau}$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}_1\\geq \\underline{\\tau}$ and $\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} - \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|R\\geq \\tau\\\\} \\leq \\epsilon, \\forall \\tau>\\underline{\\tau}$, we can show that $ \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|\\tilde{Z}=1\\\\} > \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z=1\\\\}$. That is, $\\tilde{Z}$ has a better accuracy compared to $Z$. This is a contradiction because $Z$ is derived from the optimal thresholds of optimization problem (13). \n\nThis theorem implies that if $R$ is sufficiently informative about $Y=1$, then predictor $Z$ obtained by thresholding $R$ is sufficiently accurate. The theorem and the complete proof will be added to the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The fairness notion is similar to existing notions and has the same form of equality of group wise probabilities. Fairness in selection problems has previously been studied. Guaranteeing fairness when only privatized attributes are available has been studied in classification. The novelty in this paper is studying this new fairness notion in the selection setting (repeated i.i.d. classification) with private attributes (only at test time).  The postprocessing approach is a very interesting technical result and approach, and not obvious. However, the selection setting considered is only studied for a single selection, does not study dynamics of selections on each other (because it studies single selections) and only studies the setting for binary sensitive attributes (but I understand this may only complicate theory but not the approach). \n\nQuality: The theorems and technical details are sound and complete. Some crucial experimental details are missing especially how 1) they simulated selection problems from the static datasets and 2) how the optimization was performed and thresholds chosen for EO and the baselines and 3) how exactly they computed the statistics. Furthermore, I am unsure about one of the results in table 1. \n\nClarity: The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The basis of the paper is the following sentence  \u201cdecisions are fair if the (qualified) applicants from different groups are\nselected at the same rate.\u201d,  this implies in classification that P(R=1|Y=1,A=0)=P(R=1|Y=1,A=1) (EO) but Theorem 1 says otherwise, what the authors actually mean is that decisions are fair if we select the same number of qualified individuals from different groups and not \u201crates\u201d. I think the proposed notion (ESR) is fundamentally very very different from EO as it is not a conditional statement . \n\nSignificance: I think this paper misses out an incredible opportunity to study selection problems by only focusing on the m=1 case and assumes i.i.d. selections and no impact of previous selections on the following ones. Due to this, I feel the \"selection\" aspect of the paper is not that novel and so it goes back to studying the ESR notion in classification problems and trying to argue for it (from theorem 1). However, the paper does not attempt to justify ESR in the classification  from an ethical perspective or long term perspective but only cites the EEOC.\n\nLimitations:  1) studying binary attributes, 2) m=1 setting \"single selection\", 3) i.i.d. between selections which is not a reasonable assumption in reality, 4) not enough argumentation, especially from a societal perspective, for why one wants ESR instead of EO. \n\nComments:\n\n re footnote 1: College admission is a subset selection problem and not sequential selection, hiring can be argued as sequential selection.\n\nHow calibrated is the pretrained model?\n\nESR extension to m>1 is not obvious what it means, also authors don\u2019t write in words what ESR signifies: The probability that we select a qualified A=0 individual vs A=1 individual should be the same, that is not the natural extension of EO.\n\nTheorem 1 is illustrative but is obvious from the definition 1 and so is corollary 1. \n\nTheorem 2 is nice, I think the proof needs to have all the steps written out (cancelling of terms more clearly) to be more easily readable. \n\nI want to see a comparison or a theoretical attempt at the difference between post-processing and in-processing with fairness, something like Theorem 5.6 in Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning  (Hardt et al., 2016).\n\nI think it is reasonable to remove Assumption 1 and assume one only observes the noisy attribute at test and train, if not I would like to see an impossibility result to justify assumption 1 as it is not reasonable to assume a discrepancy between train and test in observing the sensitive attribute.\n\nIn table 1, the result of the 0 probability of selecting the minority group is a bit odd. Consider the following  test: at each step, we sample a random individual from the population, the probability that this individual is Black and qualified is P(A=0,Y=1), if a classifier satisfies EO, then it cannot be the case that the probability of selecting a Black individual is 0 if we repeat this selection process. I need more details on how the testing was accomplished. \n\nConstraint 17 is too artificial with the \u00bd threshold. I think it is okay to consider m=1 in theorems, but in experiments not showing m>1 is a big limitation.\n\nWhat can make the paper really improve: \n1) considering m>1\n2) Considering that decisions at time step i, affect the distribution of individuals at time step i+1. \n3) theoretical results to showcase the issue with EO shown in the experiments\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPost response: I have read the authors responses. The authors do acknowledge and address some of the limitations of their study, however, I remain on my previous score as the current problem studied is still limited by the lack of any dynamics governing the population or meaningful experimental study.",
    "comment": "$\\textbf{Originality}$\n\n$\\textbf{A1. Regarding single selection:}$ As mentioned in the paper (line 128), since we are considering an i.i.d. setting, our results can be applied to a scenario where $m>1$. If $m>1$, then we have to repeat the process until $m$ applicants are selected.\nWhen $m>1$, then ESR implies that the probability that each position is filled with an applicant from group 0 is the same as that from group 1, $\\Pr\\\\{\\tilde{Y}=1\\\\}$ is the probability that a given position is filled by a qualified applicant.  \n\n$\\textbf{A2. Regarding dynamic setting:}$ Thank you for mentioning this. Yes, considering a dynamic setting would be an interesting extension and we are working on it as future work. Specifically, the participation and/or features of applicants in the future may be affected by the current decisions. For example, the high rejection rate may drive away applicants from certain groups; the applicants may exert more effort to improve features and increase the chance of being selected in the future. However, this dynamic is not the focus of the current paper. It's worth mentioning that in some applications, the current decision may not affect the feature vector of the future applicants if the decision-making process spans over a short time horizon. Consider an example of job applications, if the decision-maker rejects a person for not having a master\u2019s degree, it is not easy for future applicants to change their qualifications by earning a master\u2019s degree as it may take a few years and filing a vacant position takes only a few weeks. \n\nWe totally agree with the reviewer that the dynamic setting is an important extension, and an i.i.d. setting applies to scenarios with a short time span. We hope that the reviewer does not penalize the paper because i.i.d. setting is also applicable to some real-world scenarios. \n\n$\\textbf{A3. Binary sensitive attributes:}$ Thank you for mentioning this. Our model can be easily extended to settings with non-binary sensitive attributes, the qualitative results will remain valid. However, considering non-binary sensitive attributes only complicates the math and we do not gain anything in terms of technical contributions and qualitative results. We hope the reviewer does not penalize us for this. \n\n$\\textbf{Quality}$\n\n$\\textbf{B1. They simulated selection problems from the static datasets:}$ The only thing that we need for solving optimization problems (5) (10) (13) (15) is the joint distribution of $(R,A,Y)$. We can estimate this from the dataset. FICO dataset itself includes this distribution (Experiment 1). For experiment 2, we estimated the distribution using the Adult dataset. We will include this explanation in the final version of the paper.  \n\n$\\textbf{B2. How the optimization was performed and thresholds chosen for EO and the baselines:}$\nIn experiment 1, FICO scores are discrete. As we mentioned in line 261, if the scores are discrete, we can easily find the optimal thresholds using an exhaustive search. Even if the fairness notion is EO, exhaustive search still works.\n\nIn experiment 2, we are solving the optimization problem (10) under ESR or EO or no fairness constraint. Optimization (10) is linear in $\\beta_{\\tilde{a},\\hat{y}}$ under ESR or no fairness constraint. In line 534 of the appendix, we showed that  EO can be written as a linear constraint in $\\beta_{\\tilde{a},\\hat{y}}$. Therefore, the optimization problem (10) for EO and baseline were solved using the simplex method. \n\n$\\textbf{B3. How exactly they computed the statistics.}$ In the first experiment, the statistics are included in the dataset. In particular, FICO score dataset includes $\\Pr\\\\{R\\leq \\rho | A=a\\\\}$, $\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|R=\\rho, A=a\\\\}$ and $\\Pr\\\\{A=a\\\\}$. With these three distributions, we can calculate the joint distribution of $(R,Y,A)$. \n\nIn the second experiment, for finding the joint distribution of $(R,A,Y)$, we need to know 8 numbers/parameters ($\\Pr\\\\{R=\\rho,A=a,Y=y\\\\}, \\rho \\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}, a \\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}, y \\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} $) because $R$, $A$, $Y$ are binary. $\\Pr\\\\{R=\\rho,A=a,Y=y\\\\}$ can be estimated by counting and averaging.\n\n$\\textbf{Clarity}$\n\n$\\textbf{C1. Regarding ESR:}$ We agree with the reviewer. ESR is fundamentally different from EO and it tries to select the same number of qualified individuals from different groups. Specifically, the primary goal of ESR is to ensure the limited positions to be filled with a diverse group of people. Consider an example where 100 applicants compete for 3 positions, among all applicants 90 are from group 0 while 10 are from group 1. Under EO, it\u2019s very likely that 3 positions are all filled with people in group 0 and zero from group 1, leading to a lack of diversity. As such, to improve the diversity when the number of selections is very limited we can use the (approximate) ESR notion. We will improve the argument about the ESR notion.\n\n$\\textbf{Significance:}$\n\n$\\textbf{D1. Regarding single selection and no dynamic:}$ We have already discussed these issues in the originality section. See parts A1 and A2.\n\n$\\textbf{D2. Selection aspect is not novel:}$ It is worth mentioning that in a selection problem due to the competition, the objective function should be defined differently as compared to classification problems (as we did in this paper). Moreover, the post-processing method proposed in (Hardt et al. 2016) leads to a linear problem in classifications while leading to a non-convex optimization in selection problems; one of our contributions is that we proposed an approach to solving this non-convex optimization. Therefore, we believe that the selection aspect of the problem brings novelty to this paper. \n\n$\\textbf{D3. Justification of the ESR notion.}$  As we mentioned in C1, the primary goal of ESR is to increase diversity. Note that the ESR notion resembles the Rooney Rule -- a policy widely used in the interview process and it implies that at least one candidate from the minority group should be invited for an interview when filling a vacant position. We will add more discussion on the ESR notion (see more justification in C1). \n\n$\\textbf{Limitations:}$ \n\n$\\textbf{E1. 1) studying binary attributes}$, $\\textbf{2) m=1 setting \"single selection\"}$, $\\textbf{3) i.i.d. between selections which is not a reasonable assumption in reality}$,\n\nPlease see detailed responses to the \u201cOriginality\u201d (parts A1, A2, A3). Here is a summary: 1) Non-binary attributes do not change our results or methods, but only make the notions and math messy; 2) Our method works for $m>1$: we only need to repeat the selection process until $m>1$ applicants are selected; 3) i.i.d. selections are suitable for scenarios where the decision-making process spans over a short time horizon.\n\n$\\textbf{E2. Not enough argumentation, especially from a societal perspective, for why one wants ESR instead of EO.}$\n\nESR can effectively improve diversity when the number of selections is very limited. More justifications are provided in parts C1 and D3.\n\n$\\textbf{comments:}$\n\n$\\textbf{F1. re footnote 1: College admission is a subset selection problem and not sequential selection}$  \n\nIt is true that some admission processes can be modeled as a subset selection problem. However, some colleges indeed use rolling admissions to select students (please see https://www.princetonreview.com/college-advice/rolling-admission), which can be cast as a sequential selection problem. \n\n$\\textbf{F2. How calibrated is the pre-trained model?}$\n\nWe do not have any constraint on the pre-trained model. The method proposed in optimization problems (5) (10) (13) (15) works regardless of the calibration of the pre-trained model. However, the accuracy of the post-processing method is affected by the calibration/quality of the pre-trained model. Please see our response to the last comment of $\\textbf{Reviewer hV6x}$ to see the theorem on quality/calibration of $R$. \n\n$\\textbf{F3. ESR extension to m>1 is not obvious what it means, }$ $\\textbf{also authors don\u2019t write in words what ESR signifies:} $\n$\\textbf{ The probability that we select a qualified A=0 individual vs A=1 individual should be the same,}$ $\\textbf{ that is not the natural extension of EO.}$\n\nRegarding the extension to $m>1$: as mentioned above, to make multiple selections, we can repeat the selection process until $m>1$ applicants are selected. In this case, ESR implies that the probability that each vacant position is filled by a qualified applicant from group 0 is equal to the probability that it is filled by a qualified applicant from group 1. \n\nIt is true that ESR is not an extension of EO as they are equalizing different measures. The primary goal of ESR is to improve diversity for scenarios where the number of positions is very limited. It\u2019s similar to EO in the sense that both care about qualified individuals. We will clarify this in the paper. \n\n\n$\\textbf {F4. Theorem 2 is nice, proof should be improved}$\n\nSure. We will make it more readable. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\n$\\textbf{F5. a comparison or a theoretical attempt at difference between post-processing and in-processing}$ $\\textbf{ something like Theorem 5.6 in Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning (Hardt et al., 2016).}$\n\nPlease refer to our response to the last comment of $\\textbf{Reviewer hV6x}$ to see the theorem on quality/calibration of $R$. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "review": "The problem formulation studied in the paper is interesting. Rather than considering classification in its most general form, the authors focus on a sequential selection problem, inspired by various real-life scenarios. I appreciate this novel problem formulation and believe it is well-motivated and is worthy of further attention. The paper is well-written and is easy to follow and understand. In terms of novelty of the considered notion, to the best of my understanding, ESR is essentially equivalent to a condition regarding the true positive rates, weighted by the marginal group sizes for qualified individuals. The technical contributions are mainly through the suggested post-processing algorithms, which operate through a reduction to a linear programming problem or using a Bayesian optimization approach, and the extensions to the private case. This solution scheme seems elegant and easy to operationalize, however, as is the case with prior post-processing approaches (e.g. Hardt et al. 2016), it seems like the resulting accuracy-fairness trade-off could be sub-optimal.\n\nIn terms of technical contribution, there is no analysis or bounds regarding the accuracy loss that may result from taking the suggested post-processing approach for achieving the ESR notion, as opposed to an in-processing approach. I believe providing such bounds, even under additional assumptions, can significantly strengthen the results of paper. The authors do not have a discussion as for their choice to focus on a post-processing approach with a pre-trained classifier assumption rather than an in-processing approach. One could imagine, for example, attempting to cast the objective of accuracy under the ESR condition as a series of cost-sensitive optimization problems, as done in the reductions approach to fair learning (Agarwal et al. 2018) or one of the online variants. \n\nThe proposed ESR notion should be better motivated. For example, consider a case where the distribution consists of two groups, one with probability 0.9 and the other with probability 0.1. Assume further that the fraction of qualified individuals across both groups is 0.9. Under the ESR condition, it is necessarily the case where qualified candidates from the larger group are denied at a much higher rate. A discussion regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed notion of fairness should appear in the paper.\n\nQuestions to authors:\n\n1. Prior work has suggested a post-processing scheme for a different yet closely related fairness definition, equal opportunity, by solving a linear program (Hardt et al. 2016). Can you elaborate on the differences between the approach in the paper and previously suggested post-processing approaches, and especially Hardt et al. 2016, in terms of the difficulty of achieving EO vs. ESR and how does the different objective alter the required solution method?\n\n2. In line 83, the paper states \"Hardt et al. in [9] introduce a post-processing algorithm to find an optimal binary classifier satisfying equal opportunity\". It is important to notice that the approach of Hardt et al. does not in general guarantee optimality of the equal opportunity predictor learned, but only in very specific cases (Woodworth et al. 2017). Optimality is rather with regards to the class of post-processed predictors, which can be far from general optimality under the equal opportunity condition. Can you discuss how taking a post-processing approach affects the resulting level of accuracy for the notion of ESR comparing to the optimal, not necessarily post-processed, solution over a given base class of predictors? \n\nThe submission appears to be technically sound, although I have only glanced at proofs in the appendix. The paper cites the relevant prior work. ",
    "comment": "$\\textbf{Comment:}$ ESR is essentially equivalent to a condition regarding the true positive rates, weighted by the marginal group sizes for qualified individuals.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:}$ Yes, you are right. this has been shown in Theorem 1. \n\n$\\textbf{Comment:}$ Prior work has suggested a post-processing scheme for a different yet closely related fairness definition, equal opportunity, by solving a linear program (Hardt et al. 2016).

The post-processing method in Hardt et al. 2016 leads to a linear optimization problem. However, in selection problems, the post-processing scheme leads to a non-convex optimization problem. One of the contributions of this work is that we showed that under some $\\textbf{mild assumptions}$, the non-convex problem can be reduced to a linear program.\n\n$\\textbf{Comment:}$ The proposed ESR notion should be better motivated.

A discussion regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed notion of fairness should appear in the paper.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:}$ Thank you for the interesting example. Yes, it is true that ESR may lead to a higher rejection rate for the larger group. This is because the primary goal of ESR is to ensure the limited positions to be filled with a diverse group of people. Consider the same example where 100 applicants compete for 3 positions, among all applicants 90 are from group 0 while 10 are from group 1. Under equal rejection rate, it\u2019s very likely that 3 positions are all filled with people in group 0 and zero from group 1, leading to a lack of diversity. As such, to improve the diversity when the number of selections is very limited (i.e., under ESR condition), people from different groups need to be rejected at different rates. Note that if we want to decrease the rejection rate for the larger group, we can use an approximate version of ESR.\n\n$\\textbf{Comment:}$ In line 83, the paper states \"Hardt et al. in [9] introduce a post-processing algorithm to find an optimal binary classifier satisfying equal opportunity\". It is important to notice that the approach of Hardt et al. does not in general guarantee optimality of the equal opportunity predictor learned, but only in very specific cases (Woodworth et al. 2017). Optimality is rather with regards to the class of post-processed predictors, which can be far from general optimality under the equal opportunity condition. Can you discuss how taking a post-processing approach affects the resulting level of accuracy for the notion of ESR comparing to the optimal, not necessarily post-processed, solution over a given base class of predictors?\n\n$\\textbf{Response:}$ Thank you for bringing this up. In our setting, the quality of the predictor $R$ determines the accuracy of the derived predictor $Z$. Consider the scenario in Section 3.1, assume $Z^* = r^*(X,A)$ is the binary predictor which obtains the general optimality under ESR notion (e.g., it can be achieved with in-processing methods). Further, assume $R$ is a given predictor and we want to find predictor $Z$ satisfying ESR using the post-processing method (optimization problem (4)). We have the following theorem: \n\n  \n  $\\textsf{Theorem:}$  If $|\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} -\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|R=1\\\\} | <\\epsilon$ and $\\Pr\\\\{A=a|Y=1,R=1\\\\} = \\Pr\\\\{A=a|R=1\\\\}, \\forall a\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}$, then $|\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} -\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z=1\\\\}  | <\\epsilon$, \n\nwhere $\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\}$ and $\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z=1\\\\}$ are the accuracy of predictor $Z^*$ and $Z$, respectively. This theorem implies that under certain condition, if the accuracy of pre-trained model $R$ is sufficiently close to the accuracy of $Z^*$, then the accuracy of predictor $Z$ is also close to the accuracy of $Z^*$. \n\nWe will add this theorem to the paper to demonstrate the impact of predictor $R$\u2019s quality on the optimality of predictor $Z$.\n\n\n$\\textsf{Proof sketch:}$  Without loss of generality, suppose $\\Pr\\\\{R=1,Y=1,A=0\\\\} \\leq \\Pr\\\\{R=1,Y=1,A=1\\\\}$. Consider the following feasible point of optimization problem (4),\n\n$\\hat{\\alpha}_{00} =  0$\n\n $\\hat{\\alpha}_{10} = 0$\n\n $\\hat{\\alpha}_{01} = 1$ \n\n$ \\hat{\\alpha}_{11} =\\frac{\\Pr\\\\{R=1,Y=1,A=0\\\\}}{\\Pr\\\\{R=1,Y=1,A=1\\\\}} $\n\nUsing these parameters, we can derive a new predictor $\\hat{Z}$. Note that $\\Pr\\\\{R=1|\\hat{Z} = 1\\\\} = 1$ holds.  Since $\\hat{Z}$ is a suboptimal solution to optimization problem (4) while $Z$ is the optimal solution to (4), We have\n\n $$|\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} -\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z=1\\\\}| \\leq |\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} -\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|\\hat{Z}=1\\\\}|=$$ $$|\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} -\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|R=1\\\\}| + |\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|\\hat{Z}=1\\\\} -\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|R=1\\\\}| \\leq$$ $$ \\epsilon + |\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|\\hat{Z}=1\\\\} -\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|R=1\\\\}| $$\n \n Moreover, we have, \n $$ \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|\\hat{Z}=1\\\\} = \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|\\hat{Z}=1,R=1\\\\} = \\frac{\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|R=1\\\\}}{\\Pr\\\\{ \\hat{Z}=1|R=1\\\\}} \\Pr\\\\{\\hat{Z}=1|Y=1,R=1\\\\}$$\n $$\\Pr\\\\{ \\hat{Z}=1|R=1\\\\} = \\Pr\\\\{A=0|R=1\\\\}+ \\Pr\\\\{A=1|R=1\\\\} \\hat{\\alpha}_{11}$$\n \n $$\\Pr\\\\{\\hat{Z}=1|Y=1,R=1\\\\} = \\Pr\\\\{A=0|Y=1,R=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{A=1|Y=1,R=1\\\\}\\hat{\\alpha}_{11} $$\n \n  $$ \\rightarrow |\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z^*=1\\\\} -\\Pr\\\\{Y=1|Z=1\\\\}| \\leq \\epsilon + \\Pr\\\\{Y=1|R=1\\\\} (1-\\frac{ \\Phi_0 }{\\Phi_1} )$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi_0 :=\\Pr\\\\{A=0|Y=1,R=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{A=1|Y=1,R=1\\\\}\\hat{\\alpha}_{11}$ \n\nand $\\Phi_1:=\\Pr\\\\{A=0|R=1\\\\} + \\Pr\\\\{A=1|R=1\\\\}  \\hat{\\alpha}_{11}$\n\n\nSince $\\Pr\\\\{A=a|Y=1,R=1\\\\} = \\Pr\\\\{A=a|R=1\\\\}, \\forall a\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}$, we have $\\Phi_0 =\\Phi_1$.

    "comment": "$\\textbf{originality}$\n\n$\\textbf{Regarding Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) Problems:}$ We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We will add the related MAB literature to the related work section. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that sequential selection using a supervised learning problem is different from MAB problems. In this paper, our goal is to find a supervised learning model which is used sequentially. The decision-maker has access to the training data (or the distribution of the applicant\u2019s data) and finds a supervised model before applicants arrive at the system. However, in MAB, there is no training data, and the learning process is through exploration and exploration algorithms: at each time slot, one (or more) applicant is selected, and the true qualification status (a.k.a reward in MAB problem) of the selected applicant is revealed immediately.  This may not be realistic in applications such as hiring, admission, etc., where it may take a long time for the decision-maker to observe the true labels of selected applicants (e.g., in college admission, it takes four years for an applicant to graduate.).\n\nWe went through the suggested related literature (Joseph et al. Fairness in Learning: Classic and Contextual Bandits). This work considers the MAB problem with the $\\textbf{individual}$ fairness notion, which is totally different from our work: we consider a supervised learning problem with a $\\textbf{group}$ fairness notion. \n\nWe also went through another work mentioned by the reviewer (Metevier et al. Bandits with High Prob. Guarantees). This work considers an offline bandit problem and does not model the competition among the applicants, i.e., no limit on the number of approvals.\n\n$\\textbf{Clarity and Readability}$\n\n$\\textbf{Regarding line 183:}$ Thank you for pointing this out. By seemingly fair, we meant the decisions that satisfy common fairness notions such as equal opportunity (EO) and statistical parity (see line 184). We have shown empirically that the equal opportunity fairness notion leads to an unfair outcome (Table 1 & 2). We also conducted another experiment to show that statistical parity also leads to an unfair outcome; the new numerical results are included below and will be added to the paper. \n\nTo see why EO is not suitable for our problem, consider an example where 100 qualified applicants competing for 3 positions. Among them, 90 are from group 0 while 10 are from group 1. Under ESR, the probability that each position is filled with an applicant from group 0 is the same as that from group 1. Therefore, we expected that the selected applicants are diverse and coming from both groups. However, neither statistical parity nor equal opportunity cares about diversity, and they are likely to result in all the positions being filled by the majority groups. We will add this discussion to the paper. \n\n\n$\\textbf{Is there a reason the authors switch between parens and bracket notation for probability?}$ Thank you for mentioning this. No, there is no reason. We will make them consistent and use the bracelet for probability. \n\n$\\textbf{Significance}$\n\n$\\textbf{More numerical results regarding the statistical fairness notion.}$ Thank you for pointing this out.

    "review": "The authors propose a new method for Few shot learning of molecular properties. The proposed method achieves state of the art performance on four classification tasks (Tox21, Sider, MUV, ToxCast). As the authors argue, few shot learning for predicting molecular properties is very important for drug discovery and related applications. Collecting a large number of labels for a particular molecular property is usually expensive. Hence the proposed problem is of great practical interest. \n\nThe proposed method is novel and the experimentation is thorough, despite the evaluation being done only a small number of tasks (see question below about extending it to other tasks). The ablation study disentangles the contribution of each variant on the  final score. The paper is well written and clear. \n\nOverall, I am quite positive about this paper. I feel it tackles an important problem in a novel way and shows good performance.",
    "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for the positive comments!  For each detailed question, we provide response below. \n\n**Q1.** *Can the authors explain if it is possible to extend the methodology to regression tasks?*\n\n**A1.** Yes. A regression task estimates a regression function given K samples. It does not have classes nor prototypes. PAR and Pre-PAR can be extended to regression tasks with the following changes: \n\n- Property-aware embedding function: replace the two class prototypes in equation (2) by task embedding (which can be calculated as the average of all embeddings). In this way, property-aware molecular embeddings w.r.t the target property of the current task can still be obtained. \n\n- Adaptive Relation Graph: learn relation graph among molecules as before. As wrong neighbor cannot be easily decided like classification, one can choose not to sparsify the relation graph as a KNN graph or take K as a hyperparameter to tune.  \n\n- Loss function in equation (6): replace classification loss (i.e., cross entropy) by regression loss such as root-mean-square error; neighbor alignment loss can be used as long as $\\mathbf{A}^*_{T_\\tau}$ is defined. For example, one can set $$[\\mathbf{A}^*_{T_\\tau}]\\_{ij}=e^{-(y_{\\tau,i}-y_{\\tau,j})^2}$$ where $y_{\\tau,i}$ and $y_{\\tau,j}$ are the regression value for molecules $x_{\\tau,i}$ and $x_{\\tau,j}$ respectively. \n\n**Q2.** *The evaluation is done only on Tox21, Sider, MUV and ToxCast. Does the method transfer to other tasks from the moleculenet dataset?*\n\n**A2.** PAR and Pre-PAR can be applied to other tasks from MoleculeNet. MoleculeNet contains four types of datasets: \n\n- biophysics and physiology: these two types are already evaluated in the paper (Tox21, Sider, ToxCast belong to physiology while MUV belong to biophysics), which commonly tested in few-shot learning and transfer learning across datasets settings [1,4,16]. \n- physical chemistry: it can be handled by GIN [19], therefore the current PAR and Pre-PAR can be directly applied. \n- quantum mechanics: it require modeling electronic properties. One can replace GIN by specially designed molecular encoder such as MGCN [b1] and DimeNet [b2] which may obtain better performance. \n  \nIf the tasks are regression, one also need to adapt PAR and Pre-PAR as described in **A1** above.\n  \n\n[b1] Molecular property prediction: A multilevel quantum interactions modeling perspective.

    "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for reviewing our paper. We are sorry that writing issues may prevent you from diving into our paper. We have proofread the paper strictly. For each detailed question, we provide response below. \n\n**Q1.** *You write in summary that \"It takes GNN as the encoder to obtain property-aware molecular embeddings.\"*\n\n**A1.** GNN itself cannot obtain property-aware molecular embeddings. \n\n- As written on line 135-137, existing graph-based molecular encoders only capture generic knowledge. As a result, a molecule will obtain the same molecular embedding regardless of the target property considered in the current task. \n\n- However, a molecule can be evaluated for multiple properties (Figure 1). This leads to a one-to-many relationship between a molecule and properties, which makes molecular property prediction particularly hard. \n\n- Our proposed PAR makes the molecular embeddings property-aware by a specially designed function introduced in Section 3.2. \n\n**Q2.** *The proposed model seems to be a combination of multiple existing works, e.g., property-aware attention[16], gradient-based meta-learning strategy [9].*\n\n**A2.** Sorry for causing these misunderstandings. We elaborate the difference below. \n\n- Meta-MGNN [16] proposes task-aware attention (not property-aware attention): it calculates the average of sample embeddings as the task embedding which is then stored and used to weigh the contribution of each task in calculating the objective during meta-training. \nIn contrast, we design property-aware embedding function which first co-adapts each molecule embedding with class prototypes and further projects it to a substructure-aware space w.r.t. the target property. \nBoth the target and the methodology are different. \n- Gradient-based meta-learning strategy [9] (MAML): MAML updates the same set of parameters during meta-learning across different tasks and learning within each task. \nIn contrast, as written on line 60-63 and 181-186, we propose a new training strategy where we only fine-tune the property-aware embedding function and final classifier while keeping the other parts (graph-based molecular encoder and adaptive relation graph learning module) fixed within each task. \nThis design can help to separately capture the generic knowledge shared across different tasks and those property-aware. In ablation study, we compare PAR with variant-6 which corresponds to fine-tune all parameters by gradient descent as in MAML [9]. Results in Figure 3 and Figure 5 show our new training strategy can significantly improve the performance. \n\nOur method is proposed in particular for molecular property prediction tasks. We design three key components (line 55-63): \n\n1. property-aware embedding function to transform the generic molecular embeddings to substructure-aware space relevant to the target property;   \n2. adaptive relation graph learning module to jointly estimate molecular relation graph and refine molecular embeddings w.r.t. the target property; and  a new neighbor alignment loss to encourage the relation graph to choose correct neighbors; \n3. a new training strategy to encourage the model to capture generic and property-aware information separately.\n\nNone of these have been investigated in existing methods. Please kindly refer to R1' comments. \n\n**Q3.** *The experiment results show that the performance of PAR does not significantly surpass other baseline models w/o pretrain models, instead the pre-GNN + PAR performs the best. The effectiveness of the proposed PAR seems unimpressive.*\n\n**A3.** \n\n1. Please note that both graph-based molecular encoders learned from scratch or pretrained are useful: \n   although pretrained graph-based encoder encodes rich generic molecular information by learning enormous unlabeled data, encoders learning from scratch can carry some new insights. For example, the recently proposed DimeNet [a1] is able to model directional information such as bond angles and rotations between atoms, which has no pretrained version. As our proposed method can use any molecular encoder to obtain generic molecular embedding, it can easily accommodate any newly proposed molecular encoder w/o or w/ pretraining. \n\n2. In fact, PAR obtains the best performance among methods using graph-based molecular encoders learned from scratch, while Pre-PAR obtains the best among methods using pretrained graph-based molecular encoders. \nTo see this clearer, the table below summarizes the average improvement of PAR and Pre-PAR based on results reported in Table 2 and Table 5. \n\n| relative improvement ratio                    | Tox21 |        | SIDER |       | MUV   |       | ToxCast |       | Average |\n| --------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ------- |\n| n-shot                                        | 10    | 1      | 10    | 1     | 10    | 1     | 10      | 1     |         |\n| PAR over the best baseline w/o pretrained GIN | 1.05% | -0.62% | 2.48% | 0.20% | 0.91% | 3.12% | 4.39%   | 1.99% | 1.59%   |\n| PAR over the best baseline w pretrained GIN   | 2.36% | 1.07%  | 3.51% | 1.50% | 1.41% | 2.14% | 1.95%   | 1.00% | 1.49%   |\n\nAs shown,  PAR obtains significant better performance than the best baseline learned from scratch methods (e.g. EGNN) by 1.59%, and Pre-PAR is better than the b pretrained methods (e.g. Meta-MGNN) by 1.49%. \n\nIn the revised version, we will separately highlight the best performance among methods using graph-based molecular encoders learned from scratch and methods using pretrained graph-based molecular encoders in Table 2,3,5.\n\n[a1].

It is hard to say all these modules/strategies work effectively. The ablation study compares the performance of some variants but it only takes out one module at a time, so there is a chance that certain combinations can obtain competitive performance too.*\n\n**A4.** The 6 variants considered in ablation study can be grouped according to their evaluation target:  \n\n- Evaluate the design of property-aware embedding function: (variant-1) w/o property-aware embedding, and (variant-2) w/o context $\\mathbf{e}^c_{x_{\\tau,i}}$ in equation (2); \n- Evaluate the design of adaptive relation graph learning module: (variant-3) w/o adaptive relation graph learning, (variant-4) w/o reducing $\\mathcal{G}_{T_\\tau}$ to KNN graph, and (variant-5) w/o the neighbor alignment loss in equation (6);\n- Evaluate the effectiveness of our training strategy: (variant-6) fine-tune all parameters on line 15 of Algorithm 1.\n\nThese variants cover all components of training PAR, without overlapping functionalities. As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 6, the removal of any component leads to significant performance drop. Therefore, there is no chance that other combination of these components will obtain competitive results. \n\nBoth R1 and R3 acknowledge the value of our ablation study.   \n\n**Q5.** *The details of the pretrain model implementation are not given.*\n\n**A5.** On line 225, we mention PAR uses Pre-GNN[19]. We provide details of Pre-GNN on line 472-475 in Appendix A. In footnote 8, we provide the link to downloaded the Pre-GNN and refer the details to Appendix A of [19].     \n\n**Q6.** *why the training takes so long (2000 epochs), while the original pre-GNN only trains 100 epochs. considering such a large training epoch, it\u2019s better to report the training time for the proposed model.*\n\n**A6.** Thanks for pointing this out. We should use **episode** instead of **epoch** on line 239 as in [20,27] as we conduct episodic training. In PAR, episode corresponds to the times of repeating the while loop (line 2-19) in Algorithm 1. \n\nBesides, Pre-GNN is trained on ZINC15 dataset, whose epoch number does not apply for datasets used in this paper.  The results of 10-shot learning on Tox21 dataset are summarized below. \n\n|   Method   | Time per episode (s) | # episodes | Training time (s) |\n| :--------: | :------------------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n|  ProtoNet  |        0.592         |   ~1800    |       ~1065       |\n|    TPN     |        0.708         |   ~1800    |       ~1274       |\n|    MAML    |        1.257         |   ~1900    |       ~2388       |\n|    EGNN    |        0.726         |   ~1900    |       ~1379       |\n|    PAR     |        1.324         |   ~1800    |       ~2328       |\n|  Pre-GNN   |        0.327         |   ~1500    |       ~491        |\n| Meta-MGNN  |        1.176         |   ~1500    |       ~1764       |\n|  Pre-PAR   |        1.324         |   ~1000    |       ~1324       |\n\nAs shown, Pre-PAR is more efficient than the current state-of-the-art Meta-MGNN. Although Pre-GNN takes less time, its performance is much worse than Pre-PAR as shown in Table 2,3,5. \n\n\n**Q7.** *the dataset description on P7 L216 is not consistent with table 1.*\n\n**A7.** They are indeed consistent. The original 5868 side effect categories for 1427 compounds are grouped into 27 categories which correspond to 27 tasks in Table 1, which follows [4,16].

This is done via examples (Fig1), comparisons to works without property-specific adaptation, and examples of how learned relation graphs differ greatly across tasks.\n* The proposed model (PAR), though complex, seems to appropriately address the problem setup.\n* Strong results (only on 1-shot and 10-shot classification) + comparison to multiple baselines, for each of PAR\u2019s major dimensions.\n* Comprehensive ablations of contributions and analysis of their effects.\n\nWeaknesses - none are major, all are expanded upon below.\n\n\n\n* Somewhat unclear writing.\n* High overall complexity of the approach, adding elements to already-complex IterRefLSTM and Meta-MGNN\n* Results only on artificial few-shot settings \n\nOverall this is a strong paper, hence a score of 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n\n## Detailed review\n\n\n### Motivation and method\n\nThe paper has a strong motivation around few-shot learning and the need for property-specific adaptation of general purpose embeddings.\n\nAlso the motivation behind ensuring the relation graph (similarity  is correctly constructed for a task is well-taken, and illustrated convincingly with Fig 4,8,9. Ablations show the gain of constructing and sparsifying the similarity graph.\n\nQuestions for the authors:\n\n\n\n* Can the adjacency matrix be estimated directly from cosine similarity of embeddings, rather than doing the iterative estimation?\n\nOther minor comments: \n\n\n\n* Appendix Figure 8 row order doesn\u2019t seem to match caption? (0-1 should be ground truth versus grayscale predicted?)\n* Figure 4 - these adjacency matrices are the same but according to Fig9 and caption they should be different. Also same comment as above.\n* Figure 3 - please label the variants with a short summary to avoid having to cross-reference the text.\n\n\n### Impact / significance / results\n\n\n\n* The ablations are strong.

Proper comparison to several lines of work which were the basis for PAR.\n* Overall this paper addresses a difficult task in a better way, with strong motivation and appropriate novel methods.\n\nComments:\n\n\n\n* It would be helpful to see a section on limitations.\n* It would be interesting to see results on full tox21 / other moleculenet datasets, without artificially constraining to 1 or 10-shot classification.

    "comment": "We would like to greatly thank the reviewer for the positive comments and valuable time spent on reviewing our paper!  We are also grateful for the constructive suggestions on improving the clarity of the paper. We will revise the paper accordingly. For each detailed question, we provide response below. \n\n**Q1.** *High overall complexity of the approach, adding elements to already-complex IterRefLSTM and Meta-MGNN.*\n\n**A1.** PAR is not more complex than IterRefLSTM and Meta-MGNN. \n1. Please note that our PAR is not incremental upon IterRefLSTM nor Meta-MGNN. \n    Although all three methods use graph-based molecular encoder, the rest components of respective models are quite different (line 37-42): \n  - IterRefLSTM designs the Iterative Refinement LSTMs, \n  - Meta-MGNN constructs self-supervised tasks and calculates task embedding which is then used to weigh the contribution of each task in meta-training, \n  - Our PAR contains property-aware embedding function and adaptive relation graph learning module.\n\n2. To compare the computational cost empirically, we compare Pre-PAR with Meta-MGNN which both use pretrained graph-based molecular encoders. \nWe record the training time and training episodes which corresponds to the times of repeating the while loop (line 2-19) in Algorithm 1. IterRefLSTM is not compared due to the lack of public codes. The results of 10-shot learning on Tox21 dataset are summarized below. \n\n|   Method   | Time per episode (s) | # episodes | Training time (s) |\n| :--------: | :------------------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| META-MGNN  |        1.176         |   ~1500    |       ~1764       |\n|  Pre-PAR   |        1.324         |   ~1000    |       ~1324       |\n\nAs shown, Pre-PAR takes less time and episodes to converge. As for space requirement, as written on line 485 of Appendix B.1, Meta-MGNN runs out of memory on the large dataset ToxCast.   \n\n**Q2.** *Can the adjacency matrix be estimated directly from cosine similarity of embeddings, rather than doing the iterative estimation?*\n\n**A2.** Yes, it can but it may not be able to model relation graphs among molecules properly. \n\n1. The current adjacency matrix is estimated via a learned similarity function. As suggested, we now add a baseline: replace equation (3) by obtaining adjacency matrix by the fixed cosine similarity, which is calculated as $$[\\mathbf{A}^{(l)}_{T\\_\\tau}]\\_{ij}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)}\\_{\\tau,i})^\\top\\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)}\\_{\\tau,j}}{\\|\\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)}\\_{\\tau,i}\\|\\|\\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)}\\_{\\tau,j}\\|},$$ and keep the rest the same as PAR. Thus, this baseline also refines molecular embeddings on the relation graph constructed by cosine similarity. The results are summarized below. \n\n   As shown, PAR obtains much better performance.  This validates the necessity of learning a similarity function from the data rather than using the fixed cosine similarity. We will add this new baseline into Section 4.3. \n\n| Method  | Adjacency         | #itertaion $L$(line 9 in Alg.1) |  10-shot  |  1-shot   |\n| ------- | ----------------- | :-----------------------------: | :-------: | :-------: |\n| PAR     | cosine similarity |                1                |   81.12   |   79.67   |\n|         |                   |                2                |   80.85   |   78.36   |\n|         |                   |                3                |   80.07   |   76.44   |\n|         | equation (3)      |                1                |   81.78   |   80.02   |\n|         |                   |        **2 (reported)**         | **82.06** | **80.49** |\n|         |                   |                3                |   81.11   |   77.85   |\n| Pre-PAR | cosine similarity |                1                |   83.47   |   81.82   |\n|         |                   |                2                |   83.1    |   81.53   |\n|         |                   |                3                |   82.67   |   81.08   |\n|         | equation (3)      |                1                |   83.81   |   82.12   |\n|         |                   |        **2 (reported)**         | **84.93** | **83.01** |\n|         |                   |                3                |   84.26   |   82.44   |\n\n2. Please also note that the parameter $\\mathbf{\\theta}^r$ of the adaptive relation graph learning module includes both the parameter of MLP in equation (3) and parameter of GNN in equation (4). For a new task at meta-testing stage, $\\mathbf{\\theta}^r$ is fixed and directly used. \n\nThus, the use of adaptive relation graph molecule is not expensive. \n\n\n**Q3.** *It would be helpful to see a section on limitations.*\n\n**A3.** Thanks for the suggestion, we will add it in the paper: we leave interpreting the substructures encoded in the property-aware molecular embeddings as future works, such as connecting them to functional groups. \n\n\n**Q4.** *It would be interesting to see results on full tox21 / other moleculenet datasets, without artificially constraining to 1 or 10-shot classification. However we recognize this is following the standard set by IterRefLSTM and Meta-MGNN.* \n\n**A4.** Thanks for the suggestion. We design PAR to handle molecular property prediction tasks under few-shot learning setting. But it indeed can work on full moleculenet datasets. Following the setting of [19], we now conduct experiments on the full Tox21 dataset and summarize the results below. \nPAR takes GIN as the generic molecular encoder. \n\n| ROC-AUC score      | Learned from scratch | Pretrained |\n| ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- |\n| GIN                | 74.0                 | 78.1       |\n| PAR(GIN as encoder)| 75.1                 | 79.6       |\n\nAs shown, the design of property-aware embedding function, adaptive relation graph learning module, and the neighbor alignment loss are helpful to improve the performance of GIN on standard supervised learning. \n\n\n**Q5.** *What is the $\\mathbf{e}^p_{x_{\\tau,i}}$ initialization value for equation(2)?*\n\n**A5.** $\\mathbf{e}^p_{x_{\\tau,i}}$ is transformed from $\\mathbf{e}^g_{x_{\\tau,i}}$, which does not need initialization. The confusion may come from our typo, we now rewrite line 137-139 as:\n\"Let $\\mathbf{p}\\_c$ denotes the class prototype for class $c\\in\\{0,1\\}$, which is computed as the average of $\\mathbf{e}^g\\_{x\\_{\\tau,i}}$ in $\\mathcal{S}\\_\\tau$ whose $y\\_{\\tau,i}=c$. \nWe model the context for $x\\_{\\tau,i}$ as $\\mathbf{C}\\_{\\tau,i}=[{(\\mathbf{e}^g\\_{x\\_{\\tau,i}})}^\\top;\\mathbf{p}^\\top\\_0;\\mathbf{p}^\\top\\_1]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times d^g}$.\" \n\n\n**Q6.** *superscript is used for both classifier parameter $\\mathbf{\\theta}^c$ and context embedding $\\mathbf{e}^c$, which occur in two different stages?*\n\n**A6.** We will use 'b' superscript to denote context instead. \n\n**Q7.** *Minor comments and typos.* \n\n**A7.** Thank you for the advices on improving the clarity of this paper. We will revise the paper accordingly. \n\n- In Figure 4, we wrongly paste adjacency matrices for the 11th task twice. Please refer to Figure 8 in Appendix B.2.3. In Figure 8, the 1st row is $\\mathbf{A}_{T\\_\\tau}^*$ calculated using ground-truth labels and the 2nd row is adjacency matrix learned by PAR. \n- Figure 5 (d) should be 12th task. \n- We will label the variants in Figure 3 as below. \n\n| old-name  | new-name | description                                                  |\n| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| variant-1 | P-emb    | w/o property-aware embedding                                 |\n| variant-2 | P-ctx    | w/o context in equation (2)                                  |\n| variant-3 | R-g      | w/o adaptive relation graph                                  |\n| variant-4 | R-knn    | w/o KNN selection in relation graph                          |\n| variant-5 | L-adj    | w/o the neighbor (adjacency) alignment loss in equation (6)  |\n| variant-6 | tuneall  | fine-tune all parameters                                     |",

    "review": "The paper identifies an issue with the increased variance of the target estimation in DrQ (image-based RL with data augmentation). The authors conjecture two root causes for the increased variance: non-deterministic Q-targets and over-regularization.\nTo remedy these issues they propose to apply data augmentation more carefully. Specifically, the authors suggest to mix augmented and un-augmented inputs to the critic and stop augmenting of the actor's inputs. This method is then empirically justified in a series of experiment on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite.\n\nPros:\n* The author investigate an interesting question of an effect of data augmentation on generalization in image-based RL. \n* The method is thoroughly verified in different settings. \n* The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.\n* The exploration of alternative architecture, such as ViT.\n\nCons:\n* The paper proposes a small trick that lacks in novelty. The impact of data-augmentation on the estimation variance was also studied in the original DrQ paper (Kostrikov et. al), where a very similar technique was proposed -- the target estimation was done over 2 different augmentations. This work introduces a tiny modification of the DrQ's variance reduction approach, that just combines one augmented and one un-augmented observation instead of combining two augmented observations. Furthermore, the authors fail to mention this prior result in their paper and compare to it. \n* From the paper it is not clear what hyper-parameters are used for the baselines, specifically for DrQ. If the authors use the original DrQ's parameters, then I see several major issues with the empirical results: 1) SVEA uses encoder arch that consists of 11 conv layers, while DrQ only uses 4. 2) The size of replay buffer of SVEA is 500K, while DrQ's 100K. 3) SVEA virtually increases the batch size by factor of 2, which usually leads to better performance on the DeepMind Control Suite tasks, it is not clear if the authors increase batch size for DrQ or not. These discrepancies alone could result in a drastic difference in performance and can render the empirical study to be invalid. \n* There is no experiments that compare individual components of SVEA to verify is that the improved performance comes from the proposed method or better/different hyper-parameters. \n* The authors claim in line 30 that they \"theoretically ground\" their findings, but this is not the case as there is no theoretical results presented. In general, the authors don't do a good job justifying that the two pitfalls are real. Their argument is hand-wavy and is based on a series of indirect comparisons to the baseline (DrQ). Unfortunately, there are too many moving parts in those comparisons that make it virtually impossible to validate the claim (see also the point above about the hyper-parameter discrepancies).\n\nGiven the very limited scope of novelty and technical contribution, the failure to mention the prior work that is almost identical, and the inconclusive empirical study I recommend to reject this paper from a high-profile venue of NeurIPS. \n",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments. We address individual comments in the following.\n\n**Q:** *\u201c[...] Why not learn value functions without augmentations, use them to discover an optimal policy, and then use supervised learning [3, 4] to encode a robust policy? [...]\u201d*\n\n**A:** Although not the main focus of our work, we emphasize that previous works on data augmentation in RL have found that data augmentation can not only improve generalization, but also sample efficiency (e.g. RAD [28] and DrQ [26]). However, these works also show that depending on the particular task and choice of data augmentation, training performance may vary significantly. Our work reduces the brittleness of Q-learning algorithms under data augmentation, which ultimately reduces the need for experimentation, and we observe that strong augmentations improve both training and test performance in some instances. See e.g. Figure 6 (right) of our manuscript and Section 2 of supplementary material, where we find our approach also achieves better sample efficiency in training envs using augmentations. We will make this more clear in the final version of the paper.\n\n----\n\n**Q:** *\u201c[...] a policy could be derived much faster from full state representations in terms of sample efficiency and computational speed, and then have that policy supervise a vision to action mapping [...]\u201d*\n\n**A:** This is in principle a great approach, and is in fact similar in spirit to concurrent work* on generalization in RL. However, there are many instances in which full state information may not be available, and our method is therefore more generally applicable. Further, imitation learning strategies typically require a large number of trajectories, which can make them impractical to use. We welcome future work that addresses each of these challenges.\n\n\n\\* Fan et al., Self-Expert Cloning for Zero-Shot Generalization of Visual Policies, 2021\n\n----\n\n**Q:** *\u201cThere are many possible definitions of generalization in reinforcement learning [...] Which definition have you tested for in your experiments?\u201d*\n\n**A:** We investigate generalization to high-dimensional observations from unseen environments, e.g. visual (and potentially non-stationary) distribution shifts such as colors, video backgrounds, and camera poses, as shown in Figure 3+7. See Section 3 (problem formulation) for a definition of our problem setting and assumptions, and L140 for its implications on generalization.\n\n----\n\n**Q:** *\u201cCould you please clarify in the main text which experiments use some form of state information, e.g. \"proprioceptive\" data common in control tasks, as well as target object information, and which do not?\u201d*\n\n**A:** As described in L251 and L336 observations are stacks of RGB frames with no access to state information, which is arguably more general. In robotic manipulation tasks, the goal is indicated by a red mark in the environment itself, which is provided via visual input rather than state information (see Figure 7), which would be straightforward to implement in a real world setup.\n\n----\n\n**Q:** *\u201cCould you please specify for each set of results whether the set of initial states was randomized and by how much?\u201d*\n\n**A:** Initial states are randomized in all tasks considered (to prevent rote memorization). In DMControl, we use the default settings proposed in the original benchmark [55]. In robotic manipulation tasks, we randomize the initial configuration of robot, object, and goal, as described in e.g. L332; see Section 7+9 in supplementary material for initial state samples and further task descriptions.\n\n----\n\n**Q:** *\u201cThe abstract talks about generalization to novel environments and great improvements in stability and sample efficiency, it seems to me that not enough attention to detail has been expended in quantifying the limitations of this approach and the wider family of algorithms to which it belongs.\u201d*\n\n**A:** We appreciate the feedback and will adjust the final version to make this more clear. Our work can be considered a generalization of previous work on data augmentation and therefore largely have the same limitations aside from the stability issues that our method addresses. As described in Section 3 (problem formulation), we only consider generalization in observations; generalization to e.g. novel dynamics using data augmentation remains a largely unexplored topic in the literature and it is unclear whether it can even be made compatible with model-free methods without relying on extensive domain knowledge.",

We address individual comments in the following.\n\n**Q**: *\u201cI would suggest backing up the claim on Pitfall 1: Non-deterministic Q-target with some empirical data as well. How bad is the variance with non-deterministic Q-targets in practice?\u201d*\n\n**A:** Thank you for your suggestion. We are running this experiment in response to your comment and provide preliminary results here*. We evaluate Q-target variance of SVEA and the DrQ + conv baseline in three tasks from DMControl and across 3 seeds, i.e. curve is mean variance and shaded area is +-1 std. deviation across seeds. Variance is continuously estimated from multiple forward passes with the target Q-function using the same observation. For DrQ + conv, this amounts to Q-value estimations on the same observations using different augmentations; for SVEA, no (strong) augmentation is applied to the target which dramatically reduces variance, but some variance remains due to action sampling from the policy. We observe a 640x reduction in variance in the cartpole, swingup task, and 18x and 31x reduction in the walker, walk and walker, stand tasks, respectively (measured at 300k steps). We will add a more rigorous evaluation of Q-target variance in the final version of the paper.\n\n\\* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_QCA7FxBDkemqKQVWi3e_wFmVBfox64m/view?usp=sharing \n\n----\n\n**Q:** *\u201cFor the alpha and beta hyperparameter: it was mentioned that 0.5/0.5 works well for the experiments. Have the authors tried varying this parameter throughout the training (i.e. some sort of annealing schedule) [...]\"*\n\n**A:** This is an interesting proposal. We generally do not find our algorithm to be very sensitive to alpha/beta hyperparameters, but we imagine that a gradual increase in augmented data as training progresses could indeed be helpful in cases where optimization is particularly challenging. This would however introduce additional hyperparameters that may not be as trivial to choose, and would also detract from any benefits in sample efficiency that data augmentation may provide during training. For simplicity, we therefore recommend constant 0.5/0.5 values for the vast majority of use cases. We will add further discussion on this in the final version of the paper.",

The authors are not expected to respond to this review or any of the concerns presented here. * *\n\nThe paper is well-written, clear and provides a good description of the experiments. It clearly sets up the problem that standard data augmentation methods suffer from. It also provides empirical solutions to these problems and backs up these claims with experimental results. Even though the paper justifies the claims only empirically based on experimentation, the ideas proposed here have made simple and easily extendable modifications, which can be very useful in complex state action spaces when RL+Data augmentation is employed. The ideas proposed here are pretty simple and straightforward, but I am not convinced these methods alone provide us a full-fledged framework for data augmentation as claimed. Also, any theoretical justification provided with this work is not rigorous enough to demonstrate that these methods are universal for all data augmentation problems.  On the novelty front, the paper's key contribution seems to be the idea of using un-augmented inputs to the targets. There are two ways to look at this -- just as a simple innovation being not novel enough on its own or trying to understand how the work arrives at this simple innovation and whether the innovation helps improve the algorithm performance over a wide variety of tasks. I am more inclined towards the latter. I believe this is still a useful enough contribution to practitioners and researchers alike, where a few simple modifications help greatly stabilize performance.\n\nMy major concern with the paper was the hyper-parameters and architectures used for the baselines. It looks like the adapted baselines were handicapped a bit by architectural changes and these baselines were not tuned to optimality, or at least it was not very evident that this was done thoroughly. This takes a bit of the shine off the impressive results presented by the paper and I am not sure if tuning the parameters would change any relative comparison between those baselines and this method.\n\nThe paper's proposed methods are good and the results are useful on their own to the community. Having said that, because of the other minor issues mentioned earlier, I am not able to give a higher score than 6 for this paper.",

Based on Figure 4, it is not clear whether a better diffusion discretization truly yields a better solution.

    "comment": "Thank you for your review. We address your points:\n\n(1) We agree that analyzing the impact of approximate diffusion steps (e.g. via Euler-Maruyama discretization) is a natural next step. For example, it would be interesting to characterize how the error behaves as a function of the number of inner approximation steps. We believe this is an important future direction for research, but out of scope for the present work which mainly aims to study whether the asymptotic bias of previous work is unavoidable. We will clarify our abstract to avoid overstating our claims; thank you for pointing this out.\n\n(2) Regarding simulations, we agree that our experiments are not adequate to evaluate the practical performance of MLA. However, as our main contribution is theoretical in nature, we believe that it is better to leave extensive numerical comparisons for future work. We greatly appreciate the references, and we will add the comparison with [REKV20] in Table 1 as per your suggestion.\n",

    "review": "Originality: \n\nThe paper extends the approach of [DMM19] to handle a mirror descent like Langevin algorithm. To this end, the authors define a Bregman optimal transport cost that will induce the natural geometry of the algorithm. Basically, the convergence rate are provided in terms of the Bregman cost if V is relatively strongly convex and in terms of KL else.  \n\n\n\nThe algorithm is designed as a \"Forward Flow\" algorithm [Wib18], so that the convergence proof of [DMM19] can be extended to mirror descent. The algorithm has two steps. The first step is like a mirror descent descent and the second one introduce randomness following a mirror flow  (instead of a Gaussian noise in ULA). \n\nOn the practical side, unlike ULA, this mirror flow step cannot be implemented in closed form. The implementation of MLD2 should be discussed further. Can we implement it in closed form for some \\phi (other than the square norm)?\n\nOn the theoretical side, this paper is quite rich mathematically with several interesting ideas that extend those of DMM19 and can be used beyond the scope of this paper. Indeed, although there is a direct parallel between the proof of [DMM19] and this paper, the adaptation of [DMM19] is highly non trivial. Basically, every steps is more complex, in more details:\n\n-the step that looks like a gradient descent proof in DMM19 here looks like a mirror descent proof\n-the dissipation of the entropy along the mirror flow relies on the **provable** (Theorem 4) convexity of the entropy along geodesics induced by the Bregman optimal transport cost. Inspecting the proof, it is a consequence of the geodesic convexity of the entropy along generalized geodesics. \n-the dissipation of energy along the mirror flow relies in DMM19 on a simple smoothness argument and here relies on Ito calculus.\n\n\nQuality: \n\nThe paper is well written. Even the appendix is of high quality. The convergence rates are natural extensions of those of ULA, I just have some concern about the warm start assumption in Th 2 (convergence in KL divergence). Moreover, in the proof of Corollary 1, it is used that the entropy is (sub)differentiable at \\pi, and this requires implicitly the density of \\pi to be an element of S_{loc}^{1,1}(R^d) (see [AGS08, Th 10.4.13]).\n\nAdditionally, I would be happy to see the Forward flow interpretation of the algorithm in the main paper, as well as the Wasserstein mirror flow interpretation of MLD2. In particular, how do you find the formula of the velocity field?\n\nThe simulations are a bit lightweight. I understand the this work is theoretical. In Figure 2, why not plotting the ergodic means of the \\theta_k along the algorithm? (they are supposed to converge a.s. to the mean a posteriori thanks to the ergodic theorem).\n\nFinally, some cleaning is needed in the references. \n\nClarity: \n\nThe assumptions should be recall in the statement of each theorem. In particular, do the authors assume simultaneously Ass. 2 and Ass. 3 with \\alpha > 0 in Theorem 2? It seems that these assumptions are mainly incompatible (think about a Lipschitz strongly convex function for the case where \\phi is the square norm)\n\nSignificance: \n\nOverall, the paper is a smart extension of DMM19 and, even if one could argue that the practical implementation should be discussed further, the paper brings new ideas on how to use optimization techniques in sampling and that should be relevant to the community.\n\nMINOR:\n\nl.134: FYI, this is an equivalence, see [A, Lemma 2.2.1]\nl. 231: \"V is relatively convex\"\nl. 242: \"O(d) for the weakly convex case with a warm start\" Why?

    "comment": "Thank you for your detailed review. We address your points below.\n\n(1) Forward flow: This is an insightful point and this is in fact precisely the perspective taken in a follow-up work (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QijiaJ/QijiaJ.github.io/blob/master/_includes/mirror_langevin_2021.pdf). The derivation of the vector field can be found in e.g. Appendix A of the linked paper. For clarity, we will mention this interpretation in our paper as per your suggestion.\n\n(2) Closed form for diffusion: We are not aware of mirror maps that yield closed forms for the diffusion, although this seems plausible for simple choices of the mirror map. For simulations, we implemented all steps approximately.\n\n(3) Warm start in Thm. 2: Is the confusion stemming from the second statement in Thm. 2? To be clear, we do not need to assume a warm start w.r.t. the Bregman distance because the first statement of Thm. 2 provides this warm start. In other words, the conclusion of the second statement holds by starting from any initial distribution, with a number of iterations N given by the sum of the two bounds in the two statements.\n\n(4) Subdifferentiability of entropy: You are absolutely correct; in order to make the proof fully rigorous, we would need to supplement it with an approximation argument. However, our main goal in giving this corollary is simply to point out that there is a convexity statement underlying the theorem of Cordero-Erausquin; we do not wish to rigorously reprove the result because, in any case, the proof of Cordero-Erausquin holds under more general assumptions (in fact, Cordero-Erausquin does not even require log-concavity). Thank you for pointing this out; we will clarify the text accordingly.\n\n(5) Simulations: We fully agree that more extensive experiments are needed to better evaluate the practical performance MLA (your suggestion here is a good one). However, as you point out, our primary contribution is theoretical and we believe that it is better to leave further experiments for future work.\n\n(6) Assumptions: This is an excellent point. Our main motivation indeed comes from the constrained setting (the domain is compact) in which case the assumptions are not incompatible. The specific case of the squared norm mirror map is special: in the definition of our parameter \u03b2\u2019, since the self-concordance parameter is 0, then the fact that the mirror map is not Lipschitz does not enter our convergence result. We will clarify this as well as add the assumptions of the theorems to the theorem statements for clarity.\n\n(7) Limitations: Thank you for pointing this out, we will edit to reflect accordingly.\n\n(8) Minor technical comments: Thank you for the references and comments. We will address them accordingly.\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for your review. We will address your points in turn.\n\n(1) Discretization: Theoretically, our work follows the well-established Nemirovsky-Yudin model of computation which measures the complexity of an algorithm via the number of queries it makes to a local oracle (in this case, the oracle is for the gradient of the potential V). Practically, our proposed algorithm can be implemented approximately by discretizing the diffusion step more finely than the gradient step; indeed, one of our main contributions is the surprising message that vanishing bias may require treating the gradient and diffusion steps differently. It is true that our algorithm corresponds to an idealized limit when the diffusion is simulated perfectly, and a more refined analysis is required to quantify how finely the diffusion step should be discretized. However, we believe that this lies beyond the scope of the current work, which is intended to provide a clean analysis and draw attention to this new phenomenon. \n\nWe would like to also emphasize that the discretization considered in our work is conceptually useful for understanding the phenomenon we identify, and in fact it has already inspired a successful follow-up study (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QijiaJ/QijiaJ.github.io/blob/master/_includes/mirror_langevin_2021.pdf) whose conclusions agree with ours.\n\n\n(2) Comparison with mirrored Langevin: Thank you for the question; we will add a discussion of this in our paper. For context, we briefly summarize Hsieh et al.:\n\n- Algorithm: their mirrored Langevin algorithm (denoted MLA\u2019 for this response) corresponds to running the standard Langevin algorithm on the pushforward of the target distribution via the gradient of the mirror map. In particular, without the diffusion, their algorithm does not reduce to mirror descent, whereas ours does. \n\n- Main results: Their results for MLA\u2019 are twofold. \n(i) Their Thm. 3 shows that for strongly log-concave targets, there exists a good mirror map for which MLA\u2019 enjoys the same guarantees as ordinary Langevin. However, this result is only existential and gives no guidance on how to construct it.\n(ii) They also identify one example on the simplex for which they can construct a good mirror map by hand.\n\nWe list some ways that our MLA results improve upon MLA\u2019:\n\n1. Our theorem holds for any choice of mirror map which satisfies our assumptions. Also, our convergence results provide guidance on how to choose the mirror map. This lies in contrast to Thm. 3 of Hsieh et al.\n\n2. Our result applies under strictly weaker assumptions. We only require log-concavity, not strong log-concavity. Also, our relative smoothness condition allows for potentials which blow up at the boundary of their domain (i.e. the target distribution vanishes near the boundary of its support), whereas this is forbidden by the assumptions of Hsieh et al.\n\n3.  Our algorithm does not require computing the third derivative of the mirror map, whereas this is required for MLA\u2019.\n\n(3) Empirical results: We agree that further experiments are required to evaluate the practical performance of the algorithm. As our contribution is primarily theoretical in nature, our aim in providing experiments was not to demonstrate practical superiority but rather a simple sanity check.\n\n(4) Self-concordance: We would like to quickly note that our results only need the mirror map to be self-concordant not a self-concordant barrier. Hence, our results hold for various mirror maps that are not log-barriers, see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concordant_function. Assuming self-concordance without the barrier property is useful, not only to accommodate a wider range of mirror maps, but also because our convergence results when applied to self-concordant barriers do not depend on the barrier parameter (which is typically much larger than the self-concordance parameter).\n",

    "comment": "**1. Runtime analysis** \n\nOur method is scalable to the amount of target data. First, note that our memory banks only store feature vectors and prediction vectors. Second, our memory banks can store all the features/predictions for VisDA (the largest dataset in our experiments) and remain computationally more efficient than SHOT (see runtime analysis below).\n\nNevertheless, our method can also be easily adapted to lower memory and computational requirements by using a smaller bank which is replenished cyclically (following the setting in [1], only storing a fixed number of features and prediction scores). That is, they are implemented as queues where every iteration the memory banks are updated with the features/predictions of the current minibatch, while those of the oldest remaining minibatch are discarded. Thus both memory and computational requirements decrease, with a small and graceful drop in performance, yet still remaining state-of-the-art. This shows that our method can be efficient and effective even in larger datasets.\n\n\n| VisDA                         | **runtime (s/epoch with one TITAN Xp)** | Acc (%) |\n| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| SHOT                          | 618.82                                  | 82.9    |\n| **Ours**                      | 540.89                                  | 85.9    |\n| **Ours(20% for memory bank)** | 507.15                                  | 85.3    |\n| **Ours(10% for memory bank)** | 499.49                                  | 85.2    |\n| **Ours(5% for memory bank)**  | 492.28                                  | 85.1    |\n\n[1] Dwibedi, D., Aytar, Y., Tompson, J., Sermanet, P., & Zisserman, A.

How to optimally set the number of nearest/expanded neighbors, it may heavily depend on both the dimensionality of the features and the number of target data.** \n\nIt is always nontrivial to find an optimal $K$ for K-NN. Figure 4 shows some degree of robustness to these two hyperparameters, implying that we can simply set $K$ and $M$ to a small number such as 2 or 3 (only considering one neighbor is noisy) on all datasets. And we do not think it is quite sensitive to the feature dimensions since feature dimensions in our method are the same for all datasets. We will improve discussion in the paper.\n\n**3. It is not clear to see whether the final objective function is minimized if and only if all p_i are one-hot vectors with ground-truth labels.** \n\nPlease note that basically the $p_i$ will never one-hot.  Since for all those objective functions, the gradient comes only from the $p_i$ in the dot-product, maximizing the dot product is to make the $p_i$ similar to the predictions ($\\mathcal{S}_j$ which is not one-hot) of their neighbors, which is the softmaxed output of the classifier. So these objectives aim to ensure consistency between the predictions of features and their neighbors.\n\n**4. Something wrong in Eq. (7). I think both \\bar{p}_c and q_c cannot be label distribution but scalar.** \n\nThanks for pointing out this, only $\\bar{p}$ and $q$ are category distribution. $\\bar{p}_c$ is the $c$-th value of the empirical category distribution $\\bar{p}$, and the same for $q_c$.\n\n\n",

They also show that this improvement is possible, under specific hypotheses like an optimal volume-based sampler, when the dimensionality of the embedding space is small or when the batch size k is large. They also show that the optimal volume-based sampler is approximately equivalent to the Cluster-Margin algorithm. They finally show that log(k) is an upper bound on the improvement of query complexity for any sampler. \n    The authors are aware and mention that their theoretical results are initial and that equating volume based samplers and the Cluster-Margin algorithm is an open research question. \n    \n    Clarity: \n    The paper is very clear and well organized.

    "review": "Nearest Neighbour (NN) based techniques have been used extensively in DA literature to structural properties of the target domain. The paper finds that using Reciprocal NN (RNN) instead of NN provides an improvement in the performance of the model\u0010. \n\nFurther, the paper identifies certain gaps with RNN and exploits extended neighborhoods for further improvements. The ideas described in this paper are novel and have been presented well. \n\nThe results are significant and demonstrate promising accuracy for 2D and 3D computer vision tasks.\n\nConcerns:\n1. The top K/M RNN points are shown to have a higher correct ratio percentage compared to the top K/M NN points. However, the performance of the source-free model really depends on the points that lie in low confidence regions (which are typically not present in the top K) because they contribute to the majority of the samples. So even if the extended neighbourhood is considered, it is not clear how RNN could perform better than NN since the most confident samples are classified correctly anyway.\n\n2. On Eq. 1 ($\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{N}}$), each of the terms on the right-hand side ($A, \\mathcal{S}, p$) are always positive. So the dot product of these vectors will be limited to a positive regime. Wouldn't it be ideal to choose a negative $A$ value for the nRNN data point (consider it as a highly dissimilar point) that needs to be \"pushed away\" instead of $r=0.1$ (L143)? Also, in Fig. 3, a value of $r$ that lies in between -1 and 0 has not been shown. For e.g., a $r= -0.1$.\n\nSuggestions to authors:\n1. Training the model in a curriculum fashion could boost the performance of your method since the model has the flexibility to learn the signal from beyond the data points present at the top-K. [Ref 2]\n\nMinor typos:\n1. L136: \"non-reciprocal neighbors neighbors\" .. repeated words.\n2. L143: \"If not specified otherwise r is set to 0.1.\" .. remove otherwise here?\n\nConsider including the following references in your paper as they are closely related to your method.\n\n[Ref 1] Yuang Liu, Wei Zhang, Jun Wang, \"Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation', CVPR'21\n\n[Ref 2] Venkat N, Kundu JN, Singh DK, Revanur A, Babu RV, \"Your Classifier can Secretly Suffice Multi-Source Domain Adaptation\", NeurIPS'20\n\n\n",
    "comment": "**1. It is not clear how RNN could perform better than NN since the most confident samples are classified correctly anyway.** \n\nIt should be noted that the RNN and nRNN in Figure 1(b) are inside the K-NN ($K$ nearest neighbors = $K_1$ RNNs + $K_2$ nRNNs), which shows that RNN in the K-NN are of high possibility to share the same correctly predicted label. Indeed the points in the low-confidence area (typically near the decision boundary) are more important. The assumption of our method is that target features with high degree of connectivity are possibly belonging to the same class (this assumption is known as homophily and is widely use in graph clustering methods). And this is expected to hold also for those low confidence points. In that sense, our method is also related to label propagation for semi-supervised learning, but in our case labels are actually propagated from those points with higher confidence to those with lower confidence. And in this process, the RNN are more important since they have higher likelihood of belonging to the same class.\n\n\n**2. Trying different affinity values for nRNN and expanded neighbors** \n\nSince we can not really tell whether the nRNN belong to the different class or not. it is not safe to directly assign a negative affinity. We ran this experiment with r = -0.1 which gets 4.9% lower than r = 0 on VisDA. Thanks for the valuable suggestion and we will consider this improvement. \n\n**3. Related papers**\n\nWe will improve the paper and include the related works [1,2] into the paper, and also add the limitation or societal impact.\n",

The approach is based on a modified version of the popular **DeepLab** model and uses a combination of self-training and co-training to improve performance.\n\n***Methods***\n\nThe method involves training a modified **DeepLab** model on a small labeled dataset and then fine-tuning it on a larger unlabeled dataset. The model is trained using a combination of a supervised loss function and a self-supervised loss function that encourages the model to produce consistent output for the unlabeled data.\n\n***Results***\n\nThe results are presented for two benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in performance over the baseline models. The approach is particularly effective for datasets with limited labeled data.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed approach is a novel and effective method for active learning in semi-supervised segmentation.

    "comment": "**1. How to determine the parameters M and K, as shown in \"Model Details\", it seems that these two parameters are carefully tuned.**\n\nIt is always nontrivial to find an optimal $K$ for K-NN. Figure 4 shows some degree of robustness to these two hyperparameters, implying that we can simply set $K$ and $M$ to a small number such as 2 or 3 (only considering one neighbor is noisy). We will improve discussion in the paper.\n\n**2. It is not clear how to calculate the affinity matrix A. do we need to calculate the $n_t*n_t$ distance matrix for each mini-batch?**\n\nWe do not compute the affinity matrix for all target features in every mini-batch. Since we are doing mini-batch training, the computation of neighbors will only contain $\\mathcal{O}(bs \\times n_t+K \\times n_t)$ ($bs$ is the batch size), that is, in every mini-batch, we first do K-nearest neighbor retrieval for all target features in the mini-batch. Then for each of the K-nearest neighbors we further retrieve its M nearest neighbors (expanded neighbors). \n\nNevertheless, our method can also be easily adapted to lower memory and computational requirements by using a smaller bank which is replenished cyclically (following the setting in [1], only storing a fixed number of features and prediction scores). That is, they are implemented as queues where every iteration the memory banks are updated with the features/predictions of the current minibatch, while those of the oldest remaining minibatch are discarded. Thus both memory and computational requirements decrease, with a small and graceful drop in performance, yet still remaining state-of-the-art. This shows that our method can be efficient and effective even in larger datasets.\n\n| VisDA                         | **runtime (s/epoch with one TITAN Xp)** | Acc (%) |\n| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| SHOT                          | 618.82                                  | 82.9    |\n| **Ours**                      | 540.89                                  | 85.9    |\n| **Ours(20% for memory bank)** | 507.15                                  | 85.3    |\n| **Ours(10% for memory bank)** | 499.49                                  | 85.2    |\n| **Ours(5% for memory bank)**  | 492.28                                  | 85.1    |\n\n[1] Dwibedi, D., Aytar, Y., Tompson, J., Sermanet, P., & Zisserman, A.

We provide the insight that by simply considering neighbors, it is possible to achieve adaptation even without source data. To our knowledge there are no existing papers doing similar work. 2. More importantly, our major contribution is to consider reciprocity between the feature and its neighbors, which has not yet been investigated in the DA community. The cited sentence by the reviewer with respect to combination with other methods was referring to future work, we will rewrite that sentence to make this clear. \n\n[a] Pan et al., Exploring Category-Agnostic Clusters for Open-Set Domain Adaptation.

The most relevant methods are SHOT and 3C-GAN which are extensively compared in our paper. [b] focuses on semantic segmentation, and note [b] is based on synthesizing fake source samples which is a much more complex process. [c] only reports results on Office-31, which is significantly lower  than ours (83.5% versus 89.4%). [d] does not follow the mainstream experimental setting, they adopt AlexNet as backbone instead of ResNet which is used by almost all recent methods. It is therefore difficult to compare with [d]. \n\n[b] Li et al., Source-free domain adaptation for semantic segmentation.

Figure (c) shows that the samples misclassified once can be pushed toward a cluster for each class. However, it is unclear why the proposed method can form completely clean clusters.**\n\nFigure 1(c) is for illustration purpose, to show that reciprocal neighbors are considered more importantly. In addition, Fig 1b illustrated that reciprocal neighbors are more reliable. We propose a method to explicitly exploit the intrinsic neighborhood structure (and improve it by using reciprocal neighbors). The t-sne visualizations in Figure 1(a) and Figure 5 (right) show that our method performs effective feature clustering. Our method does not obtain \u2018completely clean clusters\u2019 but improves over previous methods.\n\n**4. The performance gain is sometimes very moderate**\n\nThe reviewer is right that on two dataset our gains are moderate. However, on two datasets we obtain significant performance gains: 3% and 10.1% on VisDA and PointDA-10. And more importantly, our paper provides an insight that simply considering neighborhood relation along with reciprocity can achieve source-free domain adaptation.\n\n| PointDA-10 | Avg  |\n| ---------- | ---- |\n| SHOT       | 42.5 |\n| Ours       | 52.6 |\n\n\n\n",

    "comment": "**1. How can the proposed model achieves this important property?** \n\nThanks for pointing out that the inter-cluster separability is also important. In our main training objective, we do not have explicit effort to encourage inter cluster separability, since we do not actually consider any cluster specific information, such as class prototype. However we think the usage of reciprocity of neighbors may help to form clear cluster boundaries to some degree.  From the perspective of a graph (since our method is similar to a nearest neighbor graph), the connected nodes (in our case the feature and its neighbor) with different labels will impede the formation of clusters and make the inter-cluster boundary less clear [a]. While in our method, we give lower affinity to non-reciprocal neighbors which have higher possibility to belong to different classes than reciprocal ones, thus integrating less information of those potential noisy neighbors which may lead to less clear inter-cluster boundary.  Our method also includes the diversity loss. This loss encourages that all classes are predicted for some target data, which will result in inter-cluster feature separability.  The importance of this loss on the final performance (see Question 4 of Reviewer R8cb) reflects the importance of inter-cluster feature separability for DA.  \n\n**2. Why not use the distance towards the cluster center associated to the query sample?** \n\nIndeed, the cluster prototype provides more global information than just using local neighbors. And SHOT actually considers this cluster prototype information to compute pseudo labels. In experiments our method surpasses SHOT on all datasets (3% higher than SHOT on VisDA). This may imply the noisy prediction/pseudo label may have a negative impact. We have also tried to directly combine this pseudo label with our method, thus including both local and global information, but it even gets lower results (1.5% lower on VisDA) compared to our method. Further research is required to investigate how to efficiently combine global and local information.\n\n**3. Some trade-off parameters in Eq. 9 might further promote the performance of this model.** \n\nThanks for the advice, we will introduce these trade-off parameters in the final version. However, since we want to prevent complex parameter searches, we propose to set them to 1. We actually found that with a weight factor (0.5) applied to diversity loss, we can further improve results with 0.3%. Though, we expect a full parameter search to give some further gains, we prefer to present results with the basic setting where we use the same trade-off parameters on all datasets (setting them to 1). \n\nAnd we will add the Limitations And Societal Impact part in the paper.\n\n*reference:*\n\n[a] Hongwei Wang, and Jure Leskovec. \"Unifying graph convolutional neural networks and label propagation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.06755 (2020).\n",

    "review": "Strengths:\n\n+The authors introduce a source-free domain adaptation method by using the intrinsic data structures. They propose a method for adaptation by encouraging label consistency among local target features by differentiating between nearest neighbors, reciprocal neighbors, and expanded neighbors, and further exploiting that information.\n\n+The paper is well-written with clear justification and ablation analysis of the various learning components. The approach achieves significant improvement on VisDA-C (3%)  and marginal improvement (0.4%) over the prior-art [21] on the Office-Home dataset.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1) The minibatch update of $p_i$\u2019s coupled with the self-regularization loss $L_{self}$ seems similar to an mommnetum update of $S=[p_1, p_2,..., p_{n_t}]$. While $p_i$ is computed based on the current model weights, $L_{self}$ does not allow drastic changes in $p_i$, thus acting as a regularizer. I am curious wether $L_{self}$ can be replaced by a simple momentum update of $S$. \n\n2) Following the previous, any comments on what would be the behavior if such momentum update is applied while updating $F$. As I see, all the affinity-based losses and self-regularization is applied on $p$ while $z$ is used only for neighborhood selection (i.e. for assigning affinities). What if we apply similar regularization on $z$.\n\n3) The proposed approach does not employ any pseudo-label-based loss as used in other prior arts. I am curious whether such a loss would further improve the adaptation performance. I observe that all the losses are defined on $p$, i.e., a softer form of pseudo-label.\n\n4) I am curious about the importance of the diversity loss, $L_{div}$. I would like to see the performance where all other losses are active but without the diversity loss, $L_{div}$ (in the Left and middle panel of Table 5). This would give us some idea regarding robustness of the proposed approach against imbalanced target.\n\n5) The authors claim that \u201csource-free methods outperform methods that have access to source data during adaptation\u201d (L215). They should have compared the same method with supervision from source data during adaptation. I would like them to show comparisons with other relevant non-SF prior-arts like A1. Also, can the performance of the proposed approach be improved further in the presence of source samples?\n6) The authors have set the affinity value for the expanded neighbors to an arbitrary value of 0.1 (L254). And, the authors stated that expanded neighbors should have less affinity than the nearest neighbors (L165), yet they are using the same affinity, 0.1 for both expanded neighbors and nRNNs (L143, L254). Please clarify.\n\nReferences:\n[A1] Na et al, FixBi: Bridging Domain Spaces for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation [CVPR\u201921]\n\n\n**** Post-rebuttal ****\n\nI thank the authors for the detailed rebuttal. The rebuttal addresses most of my concerns regarding the limitation which were not discussed before. Below I restate some of these:\na) In presence of source data the performance of the method degrades.\nb) Without diversity loss performance degrades significantly. This raises concerns about whether this method is at all suitable for open-set, partial, or universal DA settings.\nc) The significance of setting different affinities for the expanded neighbors and nRNNs must be clarified thoroughly.\n\nI hope that the authors would include a thorough discussion on the limitations of this approach in their revised draft. I'd like to raise the score to '6: Marginally above the acceptance threshold'.\n\n",
    "comment": "Thanks for your comments, we will improve the paper to include all the discussions below.\n\n**1. Moment updating on prediction score bank may do similar job as the self-regularization** \n\nIndeed, in Eq (3) the prediction of the data point $i$ is not taken into account, we therefore introduce the self-regularization (which can be interpreted as a regularization). Using a momentum on the memory bank could result in a more stable update for prediction scores, but Eq. (3) would still ignore the prediction at $i$, and we do not think it could be used as a replacement of Eq. (6). \n\n**2. Also moment updating on feature bank $\\mathcal{F}$ may help, and deploy similar loss on features.** \n\nEq(3) aims to prompt similar class predictions for target data points that have high affinity scores (these affinity scores are based on the locations in the features space). We do not think that additionally putting such a loss on the features itself will provide much additional gain: since imposing similar feature locations to points with high affinity is probably already true, since these are computed based on the feature position. To test this, we have applied momentum to update $\\mathcal{F}$. Results with moment updating (0.9 for old items) are almost the same as current results (0.1% improvement on VisDA). With respect to imposing additional losses on $z$: since we are using the fully connected layer classifier to give the prediction, we found additionally putting the related loss on feature $z$, which also aims to cluster target features, did not improve results.\n\n**3. The proposed approach does not employ any pseudo-label-based loss as used in other prior arts** \n\nIndeed, we do not apply any hard pseudo-labels (as for example SHOT). Combining the strength of papers that use pseudo-labels and ours could potentially further improve results. We consider this however outside the scope of the current work.  \n\n**4. The importance of the diversity loss** \n\nThe diversity loss is a widely used loss in unsupervised clustering and also domain adaptation [21, 37, 40] as mentioned in line 152, note the SRDC[21] and SHOT[40] also uses this loss. We provide the results without diversity loss below, and the SHOT also reports results without diversity loss in Table.6 of their paper, which is **63.3%** and much lower than our 76.3%. This loss is necessary since SFDA is totally unsupervised learning and easy to fall into a degeneration solution, where every sample is assigned to the same class. The author is right in pointing out that this loss might be less effective on imbalanced datasets. We will mention this in potential disadvantages of the method (we share this disadvantage with other methods that use this loss).\n\n| $L_{div}$ | $L_N$   | $L_E$   | $A$     | Avg  |\n| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---- |\n| $\\surd$   | $\\surd$ | $\\surd$ | $\\surd$ | 85.9 |\n|           | $\\surd$ | $\\surd$ | $\\surd$ | 76.3 |\n\n**5. Comparing to paper A1. Can the performance of the proposed approach be improved further in the presence of source samples?** \n\nDifferent methods are designed for the different DA settings that consider having access to source data or not. It is therefore not straightforward to run a SFDA method with source data. However, our sentence L215 confirmed an observation already made in SHOT that showed that the methods designed for SFDA actually outperformed recent methods that do use source data. We will include the CVPR 2021 paper A1 (CVPR 2021 is held after the NeurIPS submission deadline) in the paper, and adapt the claim in sentence L215. \n\nAdditionally, we have performed an experiment where our SFDA method has access to source data (for cross entropy loss) on VIsDA, and we observe in this case the target performance will degrade continually in the whole adaptation process, from 82.6% in the first epoch to 52.5% at the end. This result shows that our SFDA method is not made to exploit source data. Our SFDA method actually never aims (and is unable) to alleviate the domain shift, due to the absence of source data. So when providing source data, the performance of our method will degrade. The possible reason is that most SFDA methods like SHOT and ours are trying best to fully exploit the information of only the target domain. When applied with source data, the information from the source domain will impede the target adaptation of the SFDA method due to domain shift. As for normal DA methods, since most of them are trying to alleviate the domain shift, the source data are necessary. \n\n**6. The authors have set the affinity value for the expanded neighbors to an arbitrary value of 0.1 (L254). And, the authors stated that expanded neighbors should have less affinity than the nearest neighbors (L165), yet they are using the same affinity, 0.1 for both expanded neighbors and nRNNs (L143, L254). Please clarify.** \n\nThe affinity values of expanded neighbors are the same as the nRNNs, since both types of these neighbors are expected to be less important than RNNs. If we set the affinity of nRNN to 0.2 and of the expanded neighbors to 0.1, we can get a 0.3% improvement on VisDA. To avoid introducing more hyperparameters and hyperparameter searches, we use the same affinity values.\n\n\nWe also provide the result of SHOT for PointDA-10, which is significantly lower than ours.\n\n| PointDA-10 | Avg  |\n| ---------- | ---- |\n| SHOT       | 42.5 |\n| Ours       | 52.6 |\n\nAnd we will add the Limitations And Societal Impact part in the paper.\n",

    "review": "Strengths\n========\n\na. The motivation for various nearest neighbor strategies is clear (L42-51). The proposed reciprocal nearest neighbor approach is intuitive and makes sense. The simplicity of the approach is a key highlight of this work. \n\nb. Good work on the analysis. The figures are helpful in understanding the effectiveness of the approach. Figure 4 (Left) presents another interesting observation where per-shared fraction (measured without using target labels) converges with target accuracy (more details in the next section). The ablation study is detailed and supports the claims made in the paper. Moreover, the insights presented in this work would be highly useful for research in Source-Free Domain Adaptation.\n\nc. The manuscript is mostly easy to follow (though some clarifications and typographical fixes are required). Overall, it is a good read.\n\nd. The inclusion of code is appreciated.\n\n\nScope of improvement\n=================\n\na. Scalability: The requirement of a memory bank and nearest neighbor computation seems like a large overhead (e.g. consider large scale datasets like ImageNet). While I understand that features $z_i$ and prediction scores $p_i$ are cheaper to memoize than the input data itself, it is imperative to investigate the effect of reducing the space and computational overhead. \n\n* A runtime analysis (training time, FLOPS / epoch etc.) is required to understand the scalability of the proposed framework. Could the authors provide a runtime comparison against the prior state-of-the-art methods? \n\n* Could the authors provide more details on how the nearest neighbors are computed? A typical nearest neighbor computation would entail $O(n_t * n_t)$  operations (quadratic) for each epoch (every target feature is compared with every other feature to obtain the list of nearest neighbors). In my opinion, this is a huge overhead considering that most adaptation algorithms require $O(n_t)$ operations (linear). \n\n* Consider the following approach: Suppose the target training dataset is split into, say, 10 mutually exclusive and exhaustive folds. Each fold pertains to 10% of the data (call this, one mini-epoch) and is trained upon sequentially, i.e., we reduce the memory bank to 10% of the data, and ensure that samples in this mini-epoch pertain to the corresponding fold. After one epoch on the entire dataset is completed (i.e. after 10 mini-epochs), the data is randomly shuffled to create the next 10 folds. In this manner, the model is trained on the entire dataset, however, would require 10 times less overhead for memoization and NN-computation. Furthermore, this could reveal that perhaps only a fraction of the dataset in-memory is sufficient and the performance gain saturates with an increase in samples. If this works, then one of a major drawbacks of the proposed framework could be solved. Could the authors verify this and comment on the efficacy of this approach?\n\nb. Writing:\n\n* L147-149: This part is confusing. My understanding is that $\\mathcal{S}\\_{i}^{T}$ is a constant vector (not \u201cscalar\u201d, L147) containing the prediction scores of $x\\_i^t$. The loss $\\mathcal{L}\\_{self}$ essentially computes a weighted sum (weights = $\\mathcal{S}\\_i$) of the class probabilities ($p\\_i$). The expression is written like so (and not $p\\_i^T \\cdot p\\_i$) because the loss $\\mathcal{L}\\_{self}$ is assumed to back-propagate only through the variable $p\\_i$ and not through the weights ($\\mathcal{S}\\_i$). If this is the case, please consider paraphrasing this part to clarify the same.\n\n* Some additional improvements are suggested in Minor Comments below.\n\nc. Affinity measure: In the current formulation, affinity is a hyperparameter ($A = 1$ or $r<=1$). Thus, affinity is assigning discrete weights to the similarity between pairs of samples in Eq. 1. Did the authors consider using continuous affinity values to obtain a \u201cdegree of connectivity\u201d (L55), for e.g. using feature distance $D_{dis} = || z_i - z_j ||$)?\n\nd. The observation in Figure 4 (left) could potentially lead to a reliable convergence criterion. The usual practice in Unsupervised DA is to consider a labeled validation set for determining training convergence / selecting maximum epochs etc. A recent work [P1] presents an approach to determine training convergence without using target labels. In the proposed framework, the per-shared plot in Figure 4 (left) seems to correlate with the target accuracy. This could potentially be used as a convergence criterion. Could the authors provide more insights on this aspect?\n\n[P1] Venkat et al., \"Your Classifier can Secretly Suffice Multi-Source Domain Adaptation\", NeurIPS 2020.\n\n\nMinor Comments\n=============\n\n* A recent work by Wang et al., \u201cTent: Fully Test-Time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization\u201d, ICLR 2021 also performs source-free adaptation using entropy minimization which results in a simple approach. It would be interesting to compare the runtime vs. performance trade-off between Tent and the proposed neighborhood approach. \n\n* Typos: L273 (consistence -> consistency), L217 (date -> data), L145 (simple -> simply), L115 (weight -> weigh), L103, 232 (discusses -> discussed), Fig. 1 caption (pushed -> pushing), L34 (vary -> very).\n\n* L90, L149, L270: Avoid 1-3 worded lines to save space (paraphrase the sentence).\n\n* L45-51: Here, it would be a good idea to introduce / define RNN and nRNN so that the figure 1(c) is comprehensible. Also, in Fig. 1(c) left, consider showing nearest neighbors connectivity on the left and the RNN/nRNN plot on the right (i.e. swap the two diagrams). This would enhance readability.\n\n\nI would be happy to increase the score if my concerns are addressed.",
    "comment": "Thanks for all the advices, we will include the discussion below in any final version.\n\n**[a] - 1 and 2. Runtime analysis and more details on how the nearest neighbors are computed**  \n\nIn every mini-batch, we first do K-nearest neighbor retrieval for all target features in the mini-batch. Then for each of the K-nearest neighbors we further retrieve its M nearest neighbors. Note the competitive SFDA methods either synthesize labeled images which is hard to train and quite time-consuming (ModelAdaptation), or compute the pseudo label by using all target features every few iterations during adaptation (SHOT). We compare the runtime for one epoch of SHOT (including their proposed pseudo labeling) and our methods, specifically for SHOT the pseudo label is only computed once per epoch for all target samples, the results are below, where our method is faster than SHOT. Note we do not use any accelerated library for nearest neighbor retrieving (which would reduce complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(n_t\\ log n_t))$, which can be utilized to further speed up the training. Note that VisDA is the largest dataset (compared to Office-31 and Office-home).\n\n| VisDA                         | **runtime (s/epoch with one TITAN Xp)** | Acc (%) |\n| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| SHOT                          | 618.82                                  | 82.9    |\n| **Ours**                      | 540.89                                  | 85.9    |\n| **Ours(20% for memory bank)** | 507.15                                  | 85.3    |\n| **Ours(10% for memory bank)** | 499.49                                  | 85.2    |\n| **Ours(5% for memory bank)**  | 492.28                                  | 85.1    |\n\n\n**3. Trying to decrease the size of memory banks** \n\nThanks for the advice. Here we use another simple way to decrease the storing memory. Instead of storing all feature vectors in the memory bank, we follow the same memory bank setting as in [2] which is for nearest neighbor retrieval. The method only stores a fixed number of target features, we update the memory bank at the end of each iteration by taking the n (batch size) embeddings from the current training iteration and concatenating them at the end of the memory bank, and discard the oldest n elements from the memory bank. We report the results with this type of memory bank of different buffer size in the table above. The results show that indeed this could be an efficient way to reduce computation on very large datasets. \n\n**[b] Writing related to self-regularization** \n\nThanks for your comment on the unclear parts and we will improve this part in the final version. The self-regularization loss is exactly what you mention; the gradient is only coming from the class probabilities ($p_i$).\n\n**[c] Using continuous affinity values** \n\nThanks for the advice. Without considering reciprocal neighbors, we here also assign affinity based on the similarity between the feature and its neighbors, for feature $z_i$\u200b\u200b\u200b, inspired by instance discrimination [3] the affinity value of its $j$\u200b\u200b\u200b-th $K$\u200b\u200b\u200b-nearest neighbor $z_{ij}$\u200b\u200b\u200b is defined by: $A_{ij}=\\frac{K\\cdot exp(z_i^T z_{ij})}{\\sum_{k=1}^K exp(z_i^T z_{ik})}$\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. Note that here the degree of connectivity is a continuous number. However, this approach gets 3.1% lower performance on VisDA than using reciprocal neighbors as in the paper. Note the core of our method is reciprocity (neighbors and neighbors of the neighbors), so simply considering similarity/distance between the feature and its neighbors ignores the reciprocity information, and it is nontrivial to combine reciprocity and continuous affinity. This could be a future direction of using neighbors for SFDA.\n\n**[d] The per-shared plot in Figure 4 (left) seems to correlate with the target accuracy. This could potentially be used as a convergence criterion. Could the authors provide more insights on this aspect?** \n\nThanks for pointing out this finding. The evolution of the per-shared curve shows that the target features are forming clusters during the training. Further, it may imply that the SFDA can be regarded as an unsupervised deep clustering [1] problem. There are two mainstream directions of deep clustering, namely simultaneously or alternatively learning the feature representation and clustering assignment. SFDA is similar to the latter, where we first pretrain the model on the source domain (representation learning) and then do clustering. Compared to deep clustering, SFDA 1) has labeled source data for training and 2) category information (number and order which is dependent on the source classifier). We leave a deeper analysis of converge analysis based on per-shared features (motivated from deep clustering research) to future research.\n\n**other comments:** We will improve the paper carefully (typos, figures, the Limitations And Societal Impact part) in any revised version. And for Tent, it is designed more specifically for online setting where the target data is only used once, since many papers already try entropy minimizing [4,5] in DA (though they do not fix most parts). Tent is expected to be faster but get lower results in source free setting. We will include the discussion in the paper.\n\n*reference:*\n\n[1] Caron, Mathilde, et al. \"Deep clustering for unsupervised learning of visual features.\" ECCV 2018.\n\n[2] Dwibedi, D., Aytar, Y., Tompson, J., Sermanet, P., & Zisserman, A.

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the thorough and constructive comments. Please find the response to your questions below:\n\nQ: Figure 2 caption\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised the caption of Figure 2 to make it more self-contained by explaining all the notations in detail.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Other domains\n\nA: The reviewer is absolutely correct. Verifying if LEAPS can produce longer and more complex programs in domains that can induce more complex and compositional behaviors, such as Minecraft and CARLA, is our immediate future work.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Other program synthesis baselines\n\nA: Many program synthesis works study synthesizing Karel programs. While [1-3] learn to synthesize Karel programs from input/output pairs (i.e. input/output Karel states), [4-6] aim to infer Karel programs from videos/execution traces/Karel trajectories. However, since these works do not synthesize programs purely from reward signals to solve tasks described by MDPs, they are not directly comparable to our work.\n\n[1] \u201cLeveraging Grammar and Reinforcement Learning for Neural Program Synthesis\u201d in ICLR 2018\n\n[2] \"Improving Neural Program Synthesis with Inferred Execution Traces\" in NeurIPS 2018\n\n[3] \"Execution-Guided Neural Program Synthesis\" in ICLR 2019\n\n[4] \"Neural Program Synthesis from Diverse Demonstration Videos\" in ICML 2018\n\n[5] \"Watch, Reason and Code- Learning to Represent Videos Using Program\" in ACM Multimedia 2019\n\n[6] \"PLANS: Neuro-Symbolic Program Learning from Videos\" in NeurIPS 2020\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Sampling dataset programs\n\nA: As noted by the reviewer, generating programs by uniformly sampling all the tokens from the DSL would yield programs that mainly only contain action tokens that are \u201cnot interesting\u201d since the chance to synthesize conditional statements with correct grammar is lower. Therefore, to produce programs that are longer and deeply nested with conditional statements to induce more complex behaviors, we propose to sample programs using a probabilistic sampler. Specifically, we design an STMT_STMT (s := s1; s2 in Figure 1) token that breaks up the current token into two, each of which is resampled according to the same token distribution. By sampling the STMT_STMT and conditional tokens (WHILE, IF, IFELSE) with higher probabilities as mentioned in Table 5, we are able to obtain programs that induce more complex and longer behaviors. More details on program dataset generation with a probabilistic sampler are described in Appendix Section A.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Program embedding space smoothness on the test set\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have performed the program embedding space smoothness evaluation on LEAPS and its ablations with the test dataset programs and the result is as follows. The same trend from the train/val sets applies to the test set. We have revised the paper to incorporate this result.\n\n|            | LEAPS-P | LEAPS-P+R | LEAPS-P+L | LEAPS |\n| ---------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ----- |\n| Training   | 0.22    | 0.22      | 0.31      | 0.31  |\n| Validation | 0.22    | 0.21      | 0.27      | 0.27  |\n| Testing    | 0.22    | 0.22      | 0.28      | 0.27  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: $R_{mat}$ reward and Table 2\n\nA: We apologize for the confusion. For one program pair, $R_{mat}$ should actually be defined as the percent of times traces match (from the beginning of the trace), not the number of times they match---we thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have modified this by adding an $\\frac{1}{N}$ to $R_{mat}$\u2019s definition.\n\nIn Table 2, we calculate $R_{mat}$ between one program from the dataset and its k=10 nearest neighbor programs and take the average. Table 2 represents the average $R_{mat}$ averaged over the entire dataset. We have revised the paper to include these details in the caption of Table 2.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Equation 4 - latent behavior reconstruction loss definition\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and we have revised Eq. 4 accordingly. Specifically, we have changed $EXEC_t (\\rho)$ to $I\\\\{EXEC_i (\\hat{\\rho}) == EXEC_i (\\rho) \\\\}$, where $t \\rightarrow i$ so that it changes with the inner sum index, and $I\\{\\}$ represents the identity function so that it becomes a 1 in the case of the executed action and 0 otherwise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Figures in the Appendix\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised the paper so that all the Figures and Tables that are not presented in the main paper but the Appendix are mentioned as \u201cFigure/Table X (in Appendix)\u201c.\n",

    "review": "The paper\u2019s pros (thoroughly done scientific experiments, a different perspective on how to build generalizable policies for MDPs, and considered framing and discussion pointing out its own limitations) slightly outweigh its cons (missing related work from classical planning, confusion about the possibility for loops in decision trees, and statistically borderline results in some experiments), and I believe this paper presents a reasonable scientific effort that will be interesting for a subset of the NeurIPS community.\n\nIn the next sections I go into pros and cons in more detail, and point to areas that I would like the authors to comment on/address in their revisions. ++ is pro, -- is con.\n\nRelated work:\n++ The authors do a reasonable job of situating the work with respect to other efforts to synthesize programmatic policies from deep RL agents, program synthesis approaches, and limitations of finite state machines\n\n-- The authors make statements about decision trees not handling loops several times in the paper, but that is a somewhat misleading statement. It is possible to include loops in decision trees, but these loops must be encapsulated differently within the DSL (see Silver et al, AAAI 2020 for an example where they use a \u201cscanning\u201d function that operates like a while loop within a decision tree context). In the author\u2019s DSL, I think this would amount to having a separate \u201cLoop l := while(b, s)\u201d and to make the program \u201cp:= DEF run() : s | l\u201d. There are certainly limitations to this, and these loops cannot be generally as expressive as doing full program synthesis, but I think this statement should be watered down (or removed) within the paper. It might help to reference Silver 2020 to point out the limitations of such setups of while loops in decision trees.\n\n-- There is a missing body of work from classical planning on synthesizing policies as programs in these same structures, two references below\n1. For synthesizing for loop and while loop policies: LoopDistill (Elly Winner and Manuela Veloso, 2007)\n2. For learning policies as programs in a more expressive space: Learning Teleoreactive Logic Programs from Problem Solving (Choi and Langley)\n\nResults:\n++ I appreciated the thoroughness of ablations covering all main aspects of the program embedding learning, and the method was (mostly) explained clearly.\n++ There were many comparisons to baselines, and these baselines were mostly appropriately chosen for the domain to underscore the points of the paper (HRL to address extended actions vs. extended actions as programs, DRL-abs to address differences in input representation, VIPER to address at least one alternative program synthesis approach (although there are others that are \u201cneural\u201d and might have been more appropriate, such as REPL, Ellis et al 2019)). The baselines\u2019 hyperparameters were also reasonably optimized, as outlined in the supplement.\n\n++ The authors included exceptionally extensive supplementary material (31 pages!) with some nice visualizations of the learned program embeddings, extra details needed to reproduce the main experiments, extra experiments on transfer to unseen configurations of KAREL tasks, and code.\n\n-- many of the results are statistically insignificant given the enormous standard deviations in the tables, especially in the program reconstruction. While it seems like the full LEAPS model performs statistically better than the naive model, it *does not* seem to perform better than the baselines in a statistically significant way.\n\n-- it would have been nice to get some insight for why DRL-abs does not always perform better than DRL, as well as how these models were trained/how their parameters were validated. Could the authors comment on this?\n\n-- why can VIPER not solve the generalization task? If it\u2019s also operating on the abstract space, I would have thought it should be invariant to the grid size since it will only have information about objects in the environment? Similarly why did the authors only evaluate generalization on StairClimber and Maze? It should be trivial to expand all of the problems to larger grids and it seems a bit weird to pick only 2.\n\n-- a simple way to keep the observation size the same for DRL between different problem sizes, which would also be a more fair comparison to the LEAPS model, would be to use a fully connected network (Long*, Shelhamer*, Darrell, 2015) as the policy, as that will look at grid locations in a more local way and be invariant to problem size (see Silver, 2020 who similarly found that this type of network significantly out-performed a fully connected model for changing grid sizes). This might perform much better than the current method while also generalizing better, and be a good test of whether it\u2019s the programmatic structure of the policy that is required, or if it\u2019s more of a \u201clocality\u201d or \u201crelational\u201d requirement.\n\n-- I think details about the RL aspect of the test tasks needs to be made very clear. E.g. how many episodes does an agent get within each task? How many training tasks do the DRL agents receive before they are evaluated? How are the training tasks for these distinguished from the test tasks for generating the numbers in Table 3?\n\nDiscussion\n++ excellent pointers to limitations of the work - a crucial component of ML papers.\n-- I would have liked to see a little more discussion on why programs specifically vs. hierarchical policies vs. abstract action spaces, and how this kind of approach would be expected to work for problems that are not specifically designed for program synthesis techniques. However I recognize there isn\u2019t too much space and the authors alluded to this in the results sections.\n",
    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the thorough and constructive comments. Please find the response to your questions below:\n\nQ: Decision trees handling loops\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out with a detailed description and a reference. As noted by the reviewer, the scanning function in Silver et al, AAAI 2020 certainly can produce looping behavior (with less expressiveness, as the reviewer also points out). We have made the following changes in the revised paper to account for  this:\n- The statements in the introduction and the related work are toned down.\n- A detailed explanation of how decision trees can handle loops is added to the related work section with a reference to \u201cFew-Shot Bayesian Imitation Learning with Logical Program Policies\u201d in AAAI 2020.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Missing related work\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for suggesting the missing related works and have revised the paper to properly discuss them, including:\n- \u201cLoopDISTILL: Learning Looping Domain-Specific Planners from Example Plans\u201d in ICML 2003\n- \u201cLearning Teleoreactive Logic Programs from Problem Solving\u201d in ILP 2005\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Program synthesis baselines other than VIPER\n\nA: We selected VIPER as it is the most directly comparable baseline because it also does not need additional supervision and can be readily applied to all of our tasks with no extra assumptions over our method. In contrast, REPL and [1-3] rely on program input/output pairs to synthesize a program, and [4-6] require entire program execution traces. Also, [7] requires program templates and [8] lacks starter code.\n\n[1] \u201cLeveraging Grammar and Reinforcement Learning for Neural Program Synthesis\u201d in ICLR 2018\n\n[2] \"Improving Neural Program Synthesis with Inferred Execution Traces\" in NeurIPS 2018\n\n[3] \"Execution-Guided Neural Program Synthesis\" in ICLR 2019\n\n[4] \"Neural Program Synthesis from Diverse Demonstration Videos\" in ICML 2018\n\n[5] \"Watch, Reason and Code- Learning to Represent Videos Using Program\" in ACM Multimedia 2019\n\n[6] \"PLANS: Neuro-Symbolic Program Learning from Videos\" in NeurIPS 2020\n\n[7] \u201cProgrammatically interpretable reinforcement learning\u201d in ICML 2018\n\n[8] \u201cSynthesizing programmatic policies that inductively generalize\u201d in ICLR 2020\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Insignificant results of program reconstruction\n\nA: We agree with the reviewer that standard deviations are high in Table 1 where we compare LEAPS to its ablations. Therefore, to justify the proposed method, we also provide qualitative results showing the programs produced by LEAPS to its ablations in Appendix Figure 7, which shows that LEAPS is able to synthesize programs that are more structured and concise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: DRL vs. DRL-abs\n\nA: We hypothesize that DRL-abs does not always outperform DRL due to imperfect perception (i.e. state abstraction) design. DRL-abs takes abstract states as input (i.e. frontIsClear, leftIsClear, rightIsClear, markerPresent in our design), which only describe local perception while omitting the information of the entire map. Therefore, for tasks such as StairClimber, Harvester, and CleanHouse, which would be easier to solve with access to the entire Karel grid, DRL might outperform DRL-abs. In this work, DRL-abs\u2019 abstract states are the perceptions from the DSL we synthesize programs with to make the comparisons fair against our method as well as analyzing the effects of abstract states in the DRL domain. However, a more sophisticated design for perception/state abstraction could potentially improve the performance of DRL-abs. \n\nTo validate the performance of DRL and DRL-abs baselines, we perform a grid search over 72 hyperparameter configurations, with 5 seeds each, and report the results of the configuration with the highest final reward after training when averaged over all seeds (see Appendix Section F.1).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: VIPER generalization\n\nA: As the reviewer mentions, VIPER is operating on the abstract state space which is invariant to grid size. However, for the reasons below, it is still unable to transfer the behavior to the larger grid despite its abstract state representation. We hypothesize that VIPER\u2019s performance suffers on zero-shot generalization for two main reasons.\n- It is constrained to imitate the DRL teacher policy during training, which is trained on the smaller grid sizes. Thus its learned policy also experiences difficulty in zero-shot generalization to larger grid sizes.\n- Its decision tree policies cannot represent certain looping behaviors as they simply perform a one-to-one mapping from abstract state to action, thus making it difficult to learn optimal behaviors that require a one-to-many mapping between an abstract state and a set of desired actions. Empirically, we observed that training losses for VIPER decision trees were much higher for tasks such as StairClimber which require such behaviors. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) \n\nA: As the reviewer points out, it is possible that a DRL policy employing a fully convolutional network (FCN) can handle varying observation sizes. However, we hypothesize that the generalization performance will still be poor as there is a large increase in the number of features that the FCN architecture needs to aggregate when transferring from 8x8/12x12 state inputs to 100x100 inputs---a \\~10x input size increase that FCN is not specifically designed to deal with. \n\nUpon the request of the reviewer, we have included its results in the generalization table listed in the response to the next question. DRL-FCN, where we have replaced the policy and value function networks of PPO with an FCN, does manage to perform zero-shot transfer marginally better than DRL on Maze and Harvester. However, it obtains a negative reward on StairClimber as it attempts to navigate away from the stairs when transferring to the 100x100 grid size. Its performance is still far worse than LEAPS and VIPER on most tasks, demonstrating that the programmatic structure of the policy is important for these tasks.\n\nWe note that we performed a hyperparameter search for DRL-FCN to ensure the performances on the original grid size were sufficient before transferring. The table below compares the performance of DRL-FCN to DRL on tasks at their standard grid sizes:\n\n|           | StairClimber | Maze        | FourCorner  | TopOff      | Harvester   |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| DRL       | 1.00 (0.00)  | 1.00 (0.00) | 0.29 (0.05) | 0.32 (0.07) | 0.49 (0.07) |\n| DRL-FCN | 1.00 (0.00) | 0.97 (0.03) | 0.20 (0.34) | 0.28 (0.12) | 0.46 (0.16) |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Additional generalization experiments (FourCorner, TopOff, Harvester)\n\nA: To evaluate zero-shot generalization performance, it would require methods to work reasonably well on the original tasks. Therefore, we only considered StairClimber and Maze for generalization experiments because most methods achieve reasonable performance on these two tasks, with DRL and LEAPS both solving these tasks fully and DRL-abs solving Maze fully.\n\nUpon the request of the reviewer, we have performed additional comparisons on FourCorner, TopOff, and Harvester (excluding CleanHouse because only LEAPS has a meaningful level of performance on it). The result is summarized in the table below.\n\n|           | StairClimber | Maze        | FourCorner  | TopOff      | Harvester   |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| DRL       | 0.00 (0.00)  | 0.00 (0.00) | 0.00 (0.00) | 0.01 (0.01) | 0.00 (0.00) |\n| DRL-FCN | -0.20 (0.10) | 0.01 (0.01) | 0.00 (0.00) | 0.01 (0.01) | 0.02 (0.00) |\n| DRL-abs   | 0.00 (0.00)  | 0.04 (0.05) | 0.37 (0.44) | 0.15 (0.12) | 0.02 (0.01) |\n| VIPER     | 0.00 (0.00)  | 0.10 (0.12) | 0.40 (0.42) | 0.03 (0.00) | **0.04 (0.00)** |\n| LEAPS     | **1.00 (0.00)** | **1.00 (0.00)** | **0.45 (0.37)** | **0.21 (0.03)** | 0.00 (0.00) |\n\nThis result suggests that LEAPS generalizes well on FourCorner and maintains the best performance on TopOff. All the methods perform poorly on Harvester. In summary, LEAPS performs the best on 4 out of these 5 tasks, further demonstrating its superior zero-shot generalization performance, which aligns with the finding in the original paper. We have revised the paper to include this result and the discussion.\n",

    "submission_title": "Learning to Synthesize Programs as Interpretable and Generalizable Policies",
    "review": "This is a very substantial and impressive piece of work. Program synthesis is a very promising avenue for building RL agents that achieve better generalisation, and whose representations are humanly interpretable. A major accomplishment of this paper is to learn embeddings of programs (in a variant of the Karel language) using a VAE with a recurrent encoder and decoder and three different losses. (I\u2019m not sufficiently famiiar with recent ML literature on program synthesis to know whether this is wholly new - so I rely on other reviewers to confirm this - but it seems like a significant step to me.) The authors carry out an extensive evaluation, with careful ablations, and show the effectiveness of the approach on a number of (admittedly quite simple) RL tasks. The most important result, to my mind, comes towards the end of the main text, which is to show that learned programs generalise to out-of-distribution grid sizes, where other approaches fail. The paper is clearly written and logically organised, although the method is complex, which means that a lot of referring to the Appendix is needed to follow it. (This is not a criticism, of course; it\u2019s just a corrolary of the page limit.) Extensive material is supplied in the Appendix to back up the main paper.\n\nThere are quite a few issues in the definition of the DSL in Figure 1.\n\n1) \u201cwhile(b)\u201d should be \u201cwhile(b): s\u201d\n\n2) the definition of \u201cPerception\u201d is, at present, unused. I suspect the authors meant to write \u201cPercept h\u201d rather than \u201cPerception h\u201d, and to write \u201cpercept h\u201d in the definition of a \u201cCondition\u201d.\n\n3) Since negation is the only logical operator, the definition of  \u201cCondition\u201d should perhaps be simply \u201cpercept | not percept\u201d. (Or rather \u201cpercept h | not percept h\u201d; see (2).) At present it allows for, say, \u201cnot not not not percept\u201d, which probably unintended, and surely unnecessary.\n\n4) Don\u2019t you need some brackets in the grammar? Otherwise how do you distinguish \u201cwhile(B): (S1 ; S2)\u201d from \u201c(while(B): S1) ; S2\u201d? (Obviously this isn\u2019t an issue in normal Karel, where white space is used to indicate structure.) Indeed, from the examples in the Appendix (Fig. 6), it\u2019s clear there are more symbols used in the code than in the grammar of Fig. 1, such as \u201cc(\u201c and \u201c)c\u201d, which fulfil this bracketing function, as described in the caption. It\u2019s a minor thing, but I feel the DSL grammar in Fig. 1 should be made to match this; it\u2019s really a syntactic variant of Karel.\n\nSection 4.1: I was very curious, at this point, to know what the architecture of q_phi and p_theta was. It took me a while to hunt them down in the Appendix (Section F6). A pointer to this material in the main text (Section 4.1) would be helpful.\n\nIn the Appendix (Section F6), you state \u201cwe utilize a syntax checker \u2026 at the output of the decoder to limit predictions to syntactically valid tokens\u201d. How do you do this? Does the training loop just skip to the next sample if a syntactically incorrect program is generated? This can\u2019t be right? How do you use the syntax check?\n\nHow do you sample from the set of possible programs in order to learn the program embedding? Do they all carry out meaningful behaviours? Do they all terminate?\n\n\nTYPOS\n\nLines 81-82: \u201cThis limit the set of synthesizable programs\u201d -> \u201cThis limits the set of synthesizable programs\u201d\n\nLines 108-109: \u201cview this objective is a special case\u201d -> \u201cview this objective as a special case\u201d\n\nFigure 3 caption: \u201ctasks that demands certain behaviors\u201d -> \u201ctasks that demand certain behaviors\u201d\n\nLine 166: \u201c through supervised instead of RL gradients\u201d -> \u201c through supervised learning instead of RL gradients\u201d (presumably)\n",

We have revised the paper to incorporate the suggestions regarding adding the correct bracketing function, changing \u201cpercept\u201d to \u201cpercept h\u201d, condition\u2019s definition to \u201cpercept h | not percept h\u201d, and the \u201cwhile\u201d definition into the DSL figure. We appreciate the detailed and well-thought-out suggestions from the reviewer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Pointer to the appendix - the architecture of the program encoder and decoder\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have revised the paper to add this pointer to the end of the first paragraph of Section 4.1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Syntax checker\n\nA: We restrict our decoder from predicting syntactically invalid programs by masking out tokens that make a program syntactically invalid at each timestep. Specifically, we improve upon the syntax checker proposed in [1]. This syntax checker is designed as a state machine that keeps track of a set of valid next tokens based on the current token, open code blocks ((\\texttt{while, if, ifelse})) in the given partial program and grammar rules of our DSL. Since we generate a program as a sequence of tokens, the syntax checker outputs at each timestep a mask $M = \\\\{ \\-\\infty, 0 \\\\}^{|\\ number\\ \\ of\\ \\ tokens\\ \\ in\\ \\ DSL\\ |} \\   where\\ M_{j} = \\-\\infty$ if the j-th token is not a valid token in the current context, and 0 otherwise. This mask is added to the output of the last layer of the decoder, just before the Softmax operation that normalizes the output to a probability over the tokens. We have updated Appendix Section F6 to incorporate these details.\n\n[1] \u201cLeveraging Grammar and Reinforcement Learning for Neural Program Synthesis\u201d in ICLR 2018\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Sampling dataset programs - procedure, meaningful behaviors, and termination\n\nA: Indeed, simply generating programs by uniformly sampling all the tokens from the DSL would yield programs that mainly only contain action tokens that do not carry out meaningful behaviors since the chance to synthesize conditional statements with correct grammar is lower. Therefore, to produce programs that are longer and deeply nested with conditional statements to induce more complex behaviors, we propose to sample programs using a probabilistic sampler. Specifically, we utilize an STMT_STMT token (s := s1; s2 in Figure 1) that breaks up the current token into two, each of which is resampled according to the same token distribution.  By sampling the STMT_STMT and conditional tokens (\\texttt{while, if, ifelse}) with higher probabilities as mentioned in Appendix Table 5, we are able to obtain programs that induce more complex and longer behaviors. More details on program dataset generation with a probabilistic sampler can be found in Appendix Section A. We have also revised the section to include the above intuition.\n\nAs noted by the reviewer, these programs are not guaranteed to terminate. Therefore, we allow a maximum execution length of 100 timesteps in the environment for computing the Program Behavior and Latent Reconstruction losses. We have added this detail to Appendix Section A.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Typos\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for pointing out the errors. We have fixed them in the revised paper.",

    "review": "I enjoyed reading the manuscript and found some of the presented ideas quite interesting. As noted by the authors, the problem of synthesizing programs directly from weak reward signals is quite challenging and so other works utilize entire traces for supervision or resort to program templates. In contrast, the proposed approach is capable of synthesizing programs from the ground up using a predefined DSL that contains loops, conditional statements and domain dependent actions and perceptions.\n\nAt the core of this novel capability is the set of behavioural losses used to train a varioational autoencoder resulting in a latent space where programs with similar behaviours are grouped closer to each other. While the proposed program behaviour loss is an obvious step towards building a program autoencoder, the latent behaviour loss is a non-trivial addition which according to the ablation studies makes a sizeable contribution to the performance of the model. How did you choose the architecture of the neural program executor module and were there any speasdcial considerations driven by the DSL and family of supported programs? Once trained how closely did the neural program executor can actually match the execution of the ground truth program?\n\nAnother question that I have regarding the behavioural losses is why did you decide to use just actions? Wouldn't action-state sequences provide a stronger supervision signal especially when only fragments of the execution of the reconstructed program semantically match the ground truth trace?\n\nThe analyses, experiments and reported results clearly demonstrate that LEAPS does provide RL agents with the capability to learn programatic policies that can even generalize to larger worlds. However, there are a few more results which may be reported that I think would increase the quality of the paper:\n\n1) Traversals of the program latent space and visualizing interpolations between different programs. This will really shed more light on what the learnt latent space looks like.\n\n2) More explicit information about the computational resources and time needed to run the various experiments.\n\n3) At least one plot showing how the best found program evolves over the course of searching - complexity and losses.\n\nLastly, in figure 15 in the appendix the CEM search is described as converging to the ground truth solution, but the population of candidate solutions in fact passes right by the ground truth and never actually returns to it. Can you explain this phenomena?",
    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the thorough and constructive comments. Please find the response to your questions below:\n\nQ: Neural program executor - architecture and evaluation\n\nA: The neural program executor takes a latent program vector, current state, previous action as input and predicts a sequence of actions that execute the program. Since it does not deal with explicitly written programs structured in a DSL, we simply employ a GRU-based recurrent neural network to approximate the neural execution.\n\nTo evaluate how close the predicted neural execution traces are to the execution traces of the ground-truth programs, we consider the following metrics: \nAction token accuracy: the percentage of matching actions in the predicted execution traces and the ground-truth execution traces.\nAction sequence accuracy: the percentage of matching action sequences in the predicted execution traces and the ground-truth execution traces. It requires that a predicted execution trace entirely matches the ground-truth execution trace.\nLEAPS\u2019 neural program executor achieves an action token accuracy of 96.5% and an action sequence accuracy of 91.3% when the learning converges. We have revised the paper to incorporate this information in the Appendix.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Behavioural losses - predict action-state sequences\n\nA: As noted by the reviewer, in general, learning to predict action-state sequences can potentially provide a stronger supervision signal when optimizing the behavioral losses. Yet, in this work, we consider an environment with a deterministic transition function. Therefore, for calculating the program reconstruction loss (Eq. 2), matching program action trajectories is equivalent to matching state-action trajectories.\n\nTo calculate the latent reconstruction loss (Eq. 4), we leverage a set of different trajectories with randomly sampled starting states for each program. Thus we need a policy conditioned on at least the first state. We found this prediction task to be difficult as is, requiring teacher forcing during training and a recurrent policy, so additionally predicting the subsequent Karel environment grid states seemed to yield limited improvement in this case.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have revised the paper to incorporate this discussion into Section F in the Appendix.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Latent space interpolations\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. It would definitely be informative to traverse the learned program embedding space and visualize interpolations between different programs. \nTo learn a program embedding space that allows for smooth interpolation, we propose three sources of supervision. We aim to verify the effectiveness of it, as suggested by the reviewer, by \n1) Sampling a pair of programs from the dataset (START program  and END program below)\n2) Encoding the two programs into the learned program embedding space\n3) Linearly interpolating between the two latent programs to obtain a number of (eight) interpolated latent programs\n4) Decoding the latent programs to obtain interpolated programs (program 1 to program 8 below)\n\nThe results of several pairs of programs have been added to the revised Appendix. Here, we show two pairs of programs and their interpolations in between below as examples. Specifically, the first pair of programs are closer to each other in the latent space and the second pair of programs are further from each other. We observe that the interpolations between the closer program pair exhibit smoother transitions and the interpolations between the further program pair display more dramatic change. \n \nPrograms that are close to each other in the learned program embedding space and the interpolations in between:\n \nSTART program: `DEF run m( turnRight move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) WHILE c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) w( move w) IF c( frontIsClear c) i( move i) m)`\n \nprogram 1: `DEF run m( turnRight move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) WHILE c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) w( move w) IF c( frontIsClear c) i( move i) m)`\n \nprogram 2: `DEF run m( turnRight move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( move i) m)`\n \nprogram 3: `DEF run m( turnRight move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( move i) m)`\n \nprogram 4: `DEF run m( turnRight move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( move i) m)`\n \nprogram 5: `DEF run m( turnRight move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( move i) m)`\n \nprogram 6: `DEF run m( turnRight move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( move i) m)`\n \nprogram 7: `DEF run m( turnRight move turnLeft WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( putMarker i) m)`\n \nprogram 8: `DEF run m( turnRight move turnLeft WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( putMarker i) m)`\n \nEND program: `DEF run m( turnRight move turnLeft WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( putMarker i) m)`\n \nPrograms that are far from each other in the learned program embedding space and the interpolations in between:\n\nSTART program: `DEF run m( turnRight turnLeft turnLeft move turnRight putMarker move m)`\n\nprogram 1: `DEF run m( turnRight turnLeft turnLeft move turnRight putMarker move m)`\n\nprogram 2: `DEF run m( turnRight turnLeft turnLeft move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( putMarker w) turnRight move m)`\n\nprogram 3: `DEF run m( turnRight turnLeft move turnLeft WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( putMarker w) move m)`\n\nprogram 4: `DEF run m( turnRight turnLeft move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( turnLeft w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( move i) m)`\n\nprogram 5: `DEF run m( turnRight move turnLeft WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( move w) IF c( not c( frontIsClear c) c) i( putMarker i) m)`\n\nprogram 6: `DEF run m( move turnRight turnLeft move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( IF c( not c( rightIsClear c) c) i( putMarker i) w) m)`\n\nprogram 7: `DEF run m( move turnRight turnLeft move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( IF c( not c( rightIsClear c) c) i( turnLeft i) w) m)`\n\nprogram 8: `DEF run m( move turnRight move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( IF c( not c( rightIsClear c) c) i( turnLeft i) w) m)`\n\nEND program: `DEF run m( move turnRight move WHILE c( frontIsClear c) w( IF c( not c( rightIsClear c) c) i( turnLeft i) w) m)`\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ: Computational resources and time\n\nA: The following two machines were used to run the experiments (as reported in Section G):\n- M1: NVIDIA Titan Xp with 40 virtual CPU cores\n- M2: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti with 72 virtual CPU cores\n\nThe experiment cost (GPU memory/time) is as follows:\n- Learning Program Embedding Stage\n    - LEAPS-P:  4.2GB/13hrs on either M1 or M2\n    - LEAPS-P+R: 4.2GB/\\~44-54hrs on M2\n    - LEAPS-P+L: 8.7GB/26hrs on either M1 or M2\n    - LEAPS: 8.8GB/104hrs on M1, 8.8GB/58hrs on M2\n- Latent Program Search Stage\n    - CEM search: 0.8GB/4\\~10min (depends on the CEM population size and the number of iterations until convergence) \n- DRL/DRL-abs/DRL-abs-t\n    - 1-2GB/\\~1hr per run with parallelization across 10 processes\n- HRL/HRL-abs\n    - 1-2.5GB/\\~2.5hrs per run\n- VIPER\n    - 1GB/20\\~30 minutes (excluding the time for learning its teacher policy)\n\nWe have added the experiment cost details to Section G in the Appendix.\n",

    "review": "The paper is well-written and easy to read. The main concerns I have are about originality and result' significance.\n\n1. The contribution for the linear-time projection algorithm 3. As the paper points out, it is based on the prior work when the box constraint lower bound is universal over different experts. But for this paper's algorithm, it needs to have different lower bounds for different experts. Algorithm 3 modifies the prior work and solve this problem. But the difficulty of it is debatable. Also, I don't see any new insights from Algorithm 3 as well.\n\n2. The contribution for the Algorithm 1&2. As pointed out in the paper, this algorithm is based on prior works ideas in Eq.(12) and the partition specialists Markov chain update in [26]. The update rule in Algorithm 1&2 step 9 seems to be from the [26]'s Markov chain update and just generalizes the chain update. Because the original inefficient algorithm from [4] has the observations of Eq.(12) (which is the kind of box constraint projection), and the follow-up work [26] proposed an efficient algorithm with the Markov chain update (which is the Markov chain update rule idea for Algorithm 1&2 step 9). Based on the above arguments, there is no surprise that the algorithm 1&2 could have a mixing scheme MPP explanation in Section 4.\n\n3. The comparison in Figure 1 is unfair. For the result in this paper, it depends on the tuning parameters m (the number of unique experts) and the k (the number of switches). And this paper's result in Figure 1 depends on this prior knowledge, while the prior work [26] does not need such information, which explains the reason to have increasing values for MPP and Partition Specialists. In other words, this paper's claim on having better theoretical results out of the range m<<k is not accurate. If we only consider the m<<k case, the theoretical improvement is really minimal, only a constant term improvement.\n\n=========== After rebuttal ================\nThanks the author/s for the detailed explanation on my initial reviews.\n\nAfter checking the work [26] more carefully, I agree with the author/s that the comparison in Figure 1 is fair.\n\nHowever, for Algorithm 3's contribution on the efficient linear-time projection, I am not convinced that its contribution is significant enough given the prior work's efficient algorithm.\n\nFor my second concern on Algorithm 1&2 and the reply from the author/s, I totally agree that Algorithm 1&2 are not directly from [26]. Although we could put the correspondence between P (P_ww, P_ws, P_sw, P_ss) from [26] and \\theta, \\alpha from this paper, and we will at least achieve the performance guarantee from [26], the paper's contribution about the revelation of the Markov prior over partition specialists corresponding to a geometrically-decaying mixing scheme is not trivial.",

Because the original inefficient algorithm from [4] has the observations of Eq.(12) (which is the kind of box constraint projection), and the follow-up work [26] proposed an efficient algorithm with the Markov chain update (which is the Markov chain update rule idea for Algorithm 1&2 step 9). Based on the above arguments, there is no surprise that the algorithm 1&2 could have a mixing scheme MPP explanation in Section 4.*\n\nThe update of Algorithm 1&2 (step 9) is *not* taken from [26]. Observe that the update of the Markov partition specialists algorithm (given on line 303) has $P_{ww}$ and $P_{sw}$ in the first update of $a^t$ (this corresponds to \"$(1-\\alpha)$\" and \"$\\theta$\" from Proposition 5) and $P_{ss}$ and $P_{ws}$ (corresponding to \"$(1-\\theta)$\" and \"$\\alpha$\") in the second update of $s^t$. Compare this to lines 8&9 of Algorithm 2, which are simple convex combinations of vectors (simple mixing). It is not at all obvious at first that these two updates produce the same weights.\n\nIn [26, Thm. 2] it was shown \"that every MPP mixing scheme corresponds to a prior over partition specialists\".  Whether the converse statement \"every prior over partition specialists corresponds to a mixing scheme\" is true remains unknown.  In fact we were surprised to discover the Markov prior corresponded to the geometrically-decaying \nmixing scheme (20) of Share-$\\theta$.  The general case of the existence of the converse of [26, Thm. 2] remains open.  However, we speculate that it is unlikely that the converse will be true in general since every mixing scheme over $T$ can be defined by only $O(T^2)$ parameters while naively it seems that the parameters required to name a partition specialists prior is *much* larger.\n\nWhile [4] has the observation of (12), it is only in so far as the regret bounds remain unchanged by using projections rather than weight-sharing. Computing these projections exactly and efficiently is non-trivial. We believe that Algorithm 3 is a valuable contribution since these can now be computed at no additional computational cost to any given mixing scheme.\n\n> *3.  The comparison in Figure 1 is unfair. For the result in this paper, it depends on the tuning parameters m (the number of unique experts) and the k (the number of switches). And this paper's result in Figure 1 depends on this prior knowledge, while the prior work [26] does not need such information, which explains the reason to have increasing values for MPP and Partition Specialists. In other words, this paper's claim on having better theoretical results out of the range m<<k is not accurate. If we only consider the m<<k case, the theoretical improvement is really minimal, only a constant term improvement.*\n\nThis is incorrect you misunderstand reference [26]. Specifically see [26, Theorem 4] which requires explicit tuning of parameters depending on $m$, $k$, and $T$. All regret bounds compared in Figure 1 are optimally tuned. \n\nSummarizing the significance of the regret bound, the improvement of the bound is in the fact that we do not \"pay twice\" per switch as in (10) but rather only to \"remember\" an expert. Thus when $m \\ll k$ the improvement is small, however the improvement is most impactful when memory is only required for some experts (as illustrated in Figure 1).\n\nFinally, we note that [26, Bottom of P6] does discuss a method for autotuning \"$m$, $k$, and $T$\". The result is given, however, without proof and while we do not doubt this result we note any autotuning of [26] applies equally to our algorithms.",

    "review": "The significance of the paper is mainly in introducing the first efficient MPP algorithm to match (actually improve) the state of the art regret bound for the setting of switching experts with memory. It also introduces an efficient algorithm for computing exact relative-entropy projections into entry-wise non-uniform lower-constrained simplex, that is then used as part of an new efficient projection-based algorithm for the setting, achieving (actually improving) the SOTA regret bound. The paper also suggests (Theorem 4) the advantage of the projections-based algorithm over the MPP variant for settings with switching costs.\n\nThe presentation of the material is clear and the paper is easy to follow. Relevant references are provided and the contributions of the paper over the state of the art and related results from relevant domains are explicitly stated. I do have a couple of comments/questions nevertheless:\n\n1) To assess the significance of the improvement in the regret bound (the discussion around line 250) it would be helpful to also refer to a relevant lower bound on the achievable regret.\n2) The way I see the flow of ideas in the paper, it is first established that for a projections-based algorithm to be efficient two elements are needed - an efficient computation of the projection, and an efficient computation of $\\beta_i$ (line 176). The paper then proceeds to implement an efficient projections-based scheme, and its (efficient) MPP equivalent (section 4) having an explicit formulation of the $\\gamma$ updates. My question is going back to (12), and comparing it to the PoDS-$\\theta$ rule (15).  This should 'close the loop' in  a sense, providing an efficient formulation of a solution to (12) (which is impossible in general) for the structure introduced by the  PoDS-$\\theta$ algorithm, and using the explicit form of (20).\n\nFinally, a few suggestions/typos: \nTypo: replace $v_i$ in line 67.\nClarify what is meant by \"absolute loss\" in line 70.\nShould be $\\ln nT$ in line 79.\nInclude $k=40$ in the plot of Figure 1, not only at the caption.\n ",
    "comment": "Thank you for your review and comments. Please find our specific responses to your comments below:\n\n> *1.  To assess the significance of the improvement in the regret bound (the discussion around line 250) it would be helpful to also refer to a relevant lower bound on the achievable regret.*\n\nTo the best of our knowledge there are no known lower bounds for \"Tracking experts with memory''.  Thus you propose a good open problem.  We can improve our discussion by discussing lower bound(s) for tracking experts without memory [32 (Section 9)] with the \"log loss''.\n\n\n> *2. The way I see the flow of ideas in the paper, it is first established that for a projections-based algorithm to be efficient two elements are needed - an efficient computation of the projection, and an efficient computation of $\\beta_i$ (line 176). The paper then proceeds to implement an efficient projections-based scheme, and its (efficient) MPP equivalent (section 4) having an explicit formulation of the $\\gamma$ updates. My question is going back to (12), and comparing it to the PoDS-$\\theta$ rule (15). This should 'close the loop' in a sense, providing an efficient formulation of a solution to (12) (which is impossible in general) for the structure introduced by the PoDS-$\\theta$ algorithm, and using the explicit form of (20).*\n\nAs far as we understand the question, this is correct. As pointed out in lines 177-178 using Algorithm 3 we solve the first element of the problem, by computing the projection efficiently. The second element (computing (12) efficiently) is solved by (15), which (from line 240) gives (20) for the geometrically-decaying mixing scheme. As you say, the structure of the update gives rise to the efficient computation of (20) due the inherent property of the geometric distribution being computed efficiently.\nWe were very surprised to discover that the SOTA result [26] corresponded to this geometrically-decaying mixing scheme, and this also explains why their update can be computed efficiently.\n\n> *Typo: replace $v_i$ in line 67.*\n\n Thank you for pointing out the typo in line 67, this will be fixed. \n\n> *Clarify what is meant by \"absolute loss\" in line 70.*\n\nWe will also add the definition of the absolute loss in line 70.\n\n> *Should be $\\ln n T$ in line 79.* \n\nLine 79 is correct as is.

    "review": "The paper is very well written and a pleasure to read. The authors shed some new light on current causal structure learning algorithms by introducing the intuitive concept of varsortability. They show that varsortability is high in common simulation schemes used for benchmarking causal structure learning algorithms. Interestingly, they show that high varsortability may still be exploited after data standardization and may explain why certain continuous structure learning algorithms work so well. They motivate this possible explanation by matching the performance of their algorithm sortnregres to other algorithms. These results, however, do not imply, or proof, that varsortability is a \"causal\" explanation of why other continuous learning algorithms work so well in the presence of high varsortability. In Section 3.4 the authors give a heuristic argument why this is the case, but the paper would be much stronger if the authors could actually proof this, and state precisely under which circumstances this would hold. Part of the arguments of this section could I think be improved upon. For example, the authors state that:\n- line 239: \"We expect the residuals after the first gradient step ... to be larger ...\"\n- line 254: \"b) why performance changes once data is standardized ... causal order.\"\nwithout further explanation. It would be helpful if the authors could elaborate more on this. Nevertheless, the concept of varsortability and the benchmarking results will still be a valuable contribution to NeurIPS.\n\nMinor comments:\n- line 217-221 \"In general, ... causal order.\": What motivates these claims? I think a reference would be appropriate.\n- line 226-229: \"We do not expect combinatorial ... to be dependent on data scale.\"  Why is that?\n- line 310 \"are driven by\": Really? Or should this read as \"may be driven by\"?\n- line 292 \"sortnregress\": Why not emphasize more that this is a novel contribution?\n- Why Figure 1 only for ER-2 graphs and Table 2 only for ER-4 and SF-4 graphs?\n",
    "comment": "Thanks a lot for your thorough feedback and for highlighting the value of our contribution for causal discovery benchmarking purposes. \nWe agree that future research into the optimization for continuous structure learning would be desirable to help understand how precisely their results are impacted by varsortability.\nTo provide further evidence for the claim that their performance is largely due to the score function exploiting varsortability, we have added a new set of empirical results.\nWe find that a greedy DAG search (GDS) using the same MSE score as NOTEARS performs as good as or better than NOTEARS on raw data while suffering from the same drop in performance for standardized data in the settings shown in the main text. \nThe results (cf. Figure 1) on 10 raw instances of 50 node ER-2 graphs compare as follows:\n  \n  |SID results |min |q25|median|q75|max|\n  |---|----|--------|-----|------|-----|  \n  |NOTEARS|32.0| 162.75 |221.5 |245.25|367.0|  \n  |GDS|0.0 | 27.75| 50.5 |119.75|300.0| \n  \n\n  \n  |SHD results |min |q25|median|q75|max|\n  |---|----|--------|-----|------|-----|  \n  |NOTEARS|19.0|42.00| 48.5 |51.50 | 70.0|\n  |GDS    |1.0 | 9.75| 22.5 |30.50 | 51.0|\n\nMoreover, we have added a nonlinear version of the greedy DAG search and find that it outperforms the results of GraN-DAG (Lachapelle et al. 2019) reported in Table 2.\nWe will provide the implementations of linear and nonlinear greedy DAG search with our codebase upon publication. \n\nWe are aware that this cannot prove that continuous algorithms excell for the same reasons, but hope it can corroborate the point that variance-sensitive score functions may be a main driver of excellent performance on varsortable raw data and the observed performance drop upon standardizing the data.\nFurthermore, it emphasizes the simplification of the structure learning problem if varsortability is high and shows that even simple algorithms can obtain state-of-the-art results in these settings.\n\nRegarding the examples, we will incorporate your suggestions as follow:\n\n1. Line 238/239. So far, our statement is based on empirical findings and we have not provided a rigorous formal argument. We observe a strong positive correlation between the ordering by variance and the ordering by residuals after the first step. For small learning rates, the correlation is perfect during the first optimisation steps. (For NOTEARS' MSE-based loss function, we expect that the key is that due to continuity of the residuals X-X(a(X'X)) after the first gradient step w.r.t. the step size a, there always exists a sufficiently small positive step size such that the order of residuals after the first step agrees with the marginal variances. Future work may investigate arguments for the more subtle case of GOLEM-NV/-EV and subsequent optimisation steps.)\n\n2. Line 254. We will rearrange the sentences to clarify that this is a conjecture and add the open conjecture to the limitations in Section 6 for future research.\n\nRegarding your minor comments, we will address them in the following manner to improve our presentation:\n\n1. Line 217-221. We will change the statement as follows:  \n_\"Motivated by the strong impact of varsortability on some structure learning algorithms (cf. Appendix F.2), we advocate an empirical evaluation and reporting of varsortability when simulating additive noise models (cf. Appendix E.3 the implementation).\"_\n\n2. Line 226-229. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The statement was imprecise and the emphasis was on constraint-based/equivalent score function/residual independence test-based (combinatorial) methods. We do not expect to see the effect for combinatorial algorithms that use a score-equivalent criterion (or scale-independent (conditional) independence tests) and will include this in our revised statement. To further clarify this distinction in the article, we now include a combinatorial method that is affected by data scale: MSE-based GDS.\n\n3. Line 310. We agree and will change the statement to _\"may be driven primarily by high varsortability.\"_\n\n4. Line 292. Thanks a lot for the suggestion. We will rephrase the statement as follows:\n_\"We propose a novel baseline algorithm termed sortnregress which will serve as a reference marking the performance achievable by directly exploiting marginal variances.\"_\n\n5. We choose the settings which are predominantly used in the respective original papers of NOTEARS, GOLEM, and GraN-DAG. Due to space constraints, further results are shown in the Appendix.\n\nWe will add the open conjecture and the limitation you raise about a \"causal explanation of performance drop\" to our limitations section.",

The authors shed some new light on current causal structure learning algorithms by introducing the intuitive concept of varsortability. They show that varsortability is high in common simulation schemes used for benchmarking causal structure learning algorithms. Interestingly, they show that high varsortability may still be exploited after data standardization and may explain why certain continuous structure learning algorithms work so well. They motivate this possible explanation by matching the performance of their algorithm sortnregres to other algorithms. These results, however, do not imply, or proof, that varsortability is a \"causal\" explanation of why other continuous learning algorithms work so well in the presence of high varsortability. In Section 3.4 the authors give a heuristic argument why this is the case, but the paper would be much stronger if the authors could actually proof this, and state precisely under which circumstances this would hold. Part of the arguments of this section could I think be improved upon. For example, the authors state that: - line 239: \"We expect the residuals after the first gradient step ... to be larger ...\" - line 254: \"b) why performance changes once data is standardized ... causal order.\" without further explanation. It would be helpful if the authors could elaborate more on this. Nevertheless, the concept of varsortability and the benchmarking results will still be a valuable contribution to NeurIPS.

    "review": "The paper is written very well. I believe it is a very important paper. The paper is significant because it raises valid concerns about existing benchmarking (and results received with them) in a constructive way (see the summary section of the review for more details on the contribution). Thanks extremely much to the authors for their work on this.\n\nMany related work papers are referred to in the submission. The submission naturally relies on previous work. Based on that coverage, it is assumed that the idea and implementation, as a whole, are original.\n\nSome clarity points:\n\n* The sentence on lines 53-56: it might be helpful to clarify for a reader whether this statement (\u201c... cannot rely \u2026\u201d) is covered in those references or it is a finding/point of this submission.\n\n* Line 90: \u201cinadvertent\u201d (also similarly in line 319 and \u201cinadvertently\u201d in line 1) - are they inadvertent or potentially \u201cadvertent\u201d/natural (and the submission also refers to this question in lines 375-377)? (As far as the variables have the same meaning and it is natural for them to have the same scale?)\n\n* Some clarification/more details might be helpful for lines 169-177:\n** Line 172: \u201c... obtaining varsortability for each individual \u2026\u201d - is something like \u201ca varsortability component/part\u201d meant? (since a pair of nodes is just a part of a graph)\n** Regarding sentences \u201cEven \u2026 quickly\u201d and \u201cThe further \u2026 to the causal order\u201d - I assume the authors might be (partially) relying on the Appendix B regarding those statements. However, those statements are not trivial, to the best of my understanding, and a proof (or at least a sketch) might be essential for them. (For example, can there be some cancellation of noise on a causal path along a causal order? (As the authors mention as well in lines 212-214.))\n** Philosophically, how can we be certain that those properties are not replicated in the real world (for at least some data)?\n\n* Line 179: \u201cIf varsortability v = 1, the causal structure is identifiable\u201d - this is a strong statement. I see how it could be potentially (sometimes?) identifiable (from a \u201cpartial\u201d causal order), but I don\u2019t see why the causal structure would be necessarily identifiable in general, especially from noisy data. A proof, a sketch and/or a reference would be very helpful.\n\n* Lines 193-194: if we don\u2019t know the true data scale (and maybe there is no _true_ scale) but variables have the same meaning (e.g. seconds or meters), would a scale matter (at least for ANMs) as far as the scale that is used the same (e.g. seconds and seconds but not hours)?\n\n* Figure 1: \u201cThe performance of _sortnregress_ \u2026 matches that of \u2026\u201d - it is not an exact match. (And someone could argue NOTEARS performs somewhat better than sortnregress in some cases, although it is not clear whether there are significant differences.) It might be worth highlighting that.\n\n* Line 358: \u201clater\u201d - just to check, later to this submission\u2019s first publication (e.g. on arXiv)?\n\nSome other/minor points:\n\n* It might be helpful to define \u201cDAG\u201d in the abstract.\n\n* Line 9: \u201cwhere varsortability may be absent\u201d - can a measure be absent? (Is it meant that varsortability is low or equal to 0?)\n\n* Line 10: \u201cno longer identify\u201d - do they rather just (sometimes) identify it, generally, much worse? (They still might perform somewhat better than the \u201crandomregress\u201d, e.g. see Figure 1, top-right. Before, they also did not identify it perfectly.)\n\n* Lines 14-15: \u201c[existing?] generic benchmarks\u201d\n\n* Line 43: it might be helpful to define the \u201cMSE\u201d. (It is appreciated that there is some definition after the line 139.)\n\n* Line 94: \u201ci.i.d.\u201d presumably refer to any x^(i) overall (i can be any from 1 to n) and not to dimensions - it might be not clear from the first read although that is probably obvious in this context.\n\n* Line 101: \u201cif and only if\u201d - a reference to a proof might be helpful, even if trivial.\n\n* The equation after line 159: it might be helpful (although probably trivial) to describe what does \u201ci -> j \\in E^k\u201d mean.\n\n* It might be helpful to cover what happens with the varsortability if e.g. a graph does not have any edges.\n\n* More derivation details for section 3.4 might be helpful (e.g. in an appendix section).\n\n* Can varsortability be measured (approximately, using empirical variances) for the real dataset (as in the appendix G)?\n\n* Line 328, \u201cfrom finite-sample to the population setting\u201d - just to check, is it a reference to sections \u201cD.1 Infinite Sample\u201d and \u201cD.2 Finite Sample\u201d in the appendix (or to some other section(s))?\n\n* Line 360: \u201cscore-equivalend\u201d -> \u201cscore-equivalent\u201d ?\n\n* Line 371: \u201cis needed to .\u201d - potentially, some missing (or extra) words?\n\n* Note that the appendix was looked at (for some parts) but was not carefully checked.\n\n*\n\nGiven some of the clarity points, although I think this work is very important, I am sorry, sadly I don\u2019t feel comfortable at this point to recommend its acceptance. There is a chance though that: (a) I did misunderstand some points; (b) some points are obvious and they just were not mentioned by the authors; (c) or/and some points are valid and they can be addressed by the camera-ready version submission if the paper is accepted. Given the authors\u2019 rebuttal, to which I am looking forward, there is a chance that the score will be adjusted. Given the importance of the paper, it probably would be very beneficial for the field if it is accepted to facilitate the discussion on this important topic.\n\nAll parts of the review are provided to the best of my understanding and knowledge. Mistakes/misunderstandings in the review are possible. I kindly ask to point me to them, if any, if possible, please.\n\n*\n\n* A discussion point (of the review): The paper topic relates to an important question on whether scales are important for structure learning tasks (and how should benchmarks be constructed; and what should metrics be). If some variables have the same meaning, does it make sense (and is it essential for full possible \u201cidentifiability\u201d) to use their scales? (For example, if two variables concern time, is it natural to use seconds and seconds (without any standardisation)? And also, potentially, generally to use a consistent metric system, assuming there are some natural connections between different base units, or/and they can be naturally expressed through one another?)\n** (It also brings an interesting question on how a structure learning algorithm can try to incorporate information about different units that can\u2019t be necessarily naturally expressed through each other (e.g. numbers of people and currency (money) units) using some meaningful statistical information that describes some relationships between them (e.g. an average income or some average expense per a person); but it is out of the scope of this review.)\n\n*\n\n**For the update, please, see my message dated the 2nd of September 2021 (GMT).**\n",
    "comment": "Dear Authors, Dear Other Reviewers, Dear Area Chairs, Dear All,\n\nThanks for the other reviews and the authors' responses.\n\nThe discussion with the authors has been very helpful indeed. Thanks a lot to the authors.\n\nTaking the discussion and the edits the authors have suggested (which I assume are going to be incorporated into a revised version if the submission is accepted) into account, I have changed my score to \"6: Marginally above the acceptance threshold\" (from \"5: Marginally below the acceptance threshold\").\n\nRegarding \"a greedy forward DAG search (GDS) using a MSE score\": my opinion is that it is probably the best not to include it into the main paper (i.e. for this conference if the submission is accepted) because the relevant parts have not been comprehensively reviewed; if it is nevertheless included in the main paper, I believe it must be mentioned that those parts have not been comprehensively peer-reviewed.\n\nWhilst I think the submission is very important and also significant, my opinion is that a higher score (i.e. higher than \"6: Marginally above the acceptance threshold\") can't be considered without a comprehensive review of a modified version.\n\nYours faithfully & sincerely,\nOne of the reviewers\n",

Although the employment of transferred similarity to denoise web training data in weak-shot fine-grained classification task is new, as claimed in the paper, the combination of SimNet and DANN (Domain Adversarial Neural Networks) fails to surprise me. It seems that the proposed sample weighting and graph regularization share similar idea and intuition with MADA (Multi-adversarial Domain Adaptation), making the technical novelty not quite significant.\n2. The organization of the manuscript could be improved. I think it is not a reader-friendly choice to leave too many detailed results and analyses to Appendix (Section 5.8, Section 5.9, and Section 5.10), which may make the flow of the paper hard to follow.\n\n",

It seems that the proposed sample weighting and graph regularization share similar idea and intuition with MADA (Multi-adversarial Domain Adaptation), making the technical novelty not quite significant.\n\n**A1**. As summarized in Line 72-77, our major novelty is using transferred similarity to denoise web training data in the weak-shot setting, which has never been explored before. As for the technical solution, the graph regularization is not applied in MADA. Generally speaking, although the sample weighting and graph regularization have been widely used in previous literature, the key problem is how to use them in different tasks. We design our sample weighting and graph regularization based on the proposed cross-category similarity transfer, which is distinctive from previous works and well-tailored for the new weak-shot setting. Furthermore, since this is the first method in this new setting, we believe that it is not a drawback to make the proposed method simple and effective.",

    "comment": "**Q1**. Does the proposed method still work when the crawled web data are very dirty? \n\n**A1**. Actually, we have no image labels for novel classes from web search and thus we cannot examine or control the noisy level for each class in the real-world applications. Nevertheless, in Section \"5.8 The Impact of the Noise Ratio in Web Images\", we have explored the impact of the noise ratio using synthetic noisy data to show the robustness of our setting and method.\n\n---\n\n**Q2**. When the training set is composed of the base training set and the novel training set, the classification accuracy drops a lot in section 5.10 (the generalized setting). Respective classification results in the base test set and the novel test set should be given.\n\n**A2**. We show the detailed results in Tab.1 below, which are overall consistent with those in section 5.10, that is, the fusion of transfer learning and webly supervised learning outperforms the basic baseline for both test sets, while our method further improves the results dramatically for both test sets. Specifically, novel categories are improved significantly and base categories are promoted moderately. Although the base categories are associated with clean training data, their performance could also be suppressed by the noisy training data of novel categories (e.g., label flip noise). Thanks to the sample weighting and graph regularization, our proposed method show superior performances on both base test set and novel test set.\n\nAs for the performance drops of generalized setting against the typical setting, the overall task becomes much more difficult, because of a larger number of fine-grained categories (e.g., 50 v.s. 200 for CUB dataset) and data imbalance issue (e.g., 30 images per base category v.s. 1000 images per novel category for CUB dataset as described in Line 121-123 of Appendix). Nevertheless, we explore using an intuitive adaption for all methods in section 5.10 (with the class weighting strategy to the data imbalance issue) and have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method against baselines. As claimed in Line 122-123, we focus on the typical setting in this paper, and we would like to strengthen the solution (e.g., to better solve the imbalance issue) for the generalized setting in the future work.\n\n**Tab 1**. Accuracies (%) of different methods on base and novel test set in the generalized setting. \"Fusion1\" and \"Fusion2\" are the short names for \"SOMNet+MetaBaseline\" and \"DivideMix+MetaBaseline\", which are the two most competitive baselines as descriped in Line 312-314.\n\n| Method   | Car-Base | Car-Novel | CUB-Base | CUB-Novel | FGVC-Base | FGVC-Novel |\n :-: | :-: | :-:| :-:| :-: | :-:| :-:\n| Cls Loss | 80.9     | 63.2      | 76.3     | 64.4      | 77.7      | 74.3       |\n| Fusion1  | 81.2     | 67.1      | 76.9     | 68.7      | 78.9      | 78.4       |\n| Fusion2  | 81.9     | 67.3      | 77.0     | 69.2      | 79.3      | 79.2       |\n| Ours     | 84.1     | 69.8      | 78.4     | 72.1      | 81.1      | 83.5       |\n---\n\n**Q3**. Describe the difference between weak-shot learning and zero/few-shot learning more clearly. Respective training and test stages should be presented for better understanding of readers.\n\n**A3**. The difference in data setting is shown in Fig. 1 and described in Line 23-31, zero-shot learning setting usually learns from clean base images and semantic base/novel word vectors; few-shot learning setting usually learns from clean base images and a few clean novel images; and weak-shot learning learns from clean base images and noisy novel images. The difference in data setting inherently determines that they have different training and test stages. Moreover, different groups of methods in one field (e.g., few-shot learning setting) can also have different training and test stages. Since zero/few-shot learning is not the focus of this paper, we omit the details here. ",

The authors present a similarity transfer method. One intuitive question is how to apply such method to real-world problems? Is there any restriction?\n\n**A1**. As claimed in Line 238-242, we focus on fine-grained classification, because 1) it especially requires expert knowledge to annotate labels for fine-grained data; 2) we conjecture that semantic similarity should be more transferable across fine-grained categories, i.e., the base categories and novel categories belong to the same meta-category. Therefore, we start from transferring across fine-grained categories and extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our setting and method. Nevertheless, we have also extended our setting from fine-grained classification to general classification on ImageNet dataset, as claimed in Line 241-242 and reported in Section 5 in Appendix. The reported results indicate that our proposed idea is also effective for the general classification.\n\n---\n**Q2**. The proposed task is too complicated.\n\n**A2**. The major contribution of this paper is employing transferred similarity to denoise web training data in weak-shot fine-grained classification task, as claimed in Line 72-74. The major finding is the SOTA comparison in Section 5.5 demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed similarity transfer against baselines. We also introduce several important aspects to support our major finding and explore the proposed learning scenario, including the basic ablation study in Section 5.2, investigating our major idea \"similarity transfer\" in Section 5.3, analyzing robustness to several factors (Section 5.4, 5.7, 5.8, and 5.9), and a generalized setting in Section 5.10.",

The introduction is jumping around zero-/few- shot and web data concepts without ever clearly defining the use case that the authors want to address. In fact, I cannot figure out the use case even after reading the entire article, because the authors claim that they can learn and transfer from the web data, but experiments do not consider a real-life web dataset at all. The Problem Definition section provides a really short and abstract definition of the task. In my opinion a detailed description of the real use case transitioning to its mathematical description would have done a much better job here. The Experiments section has way too many subsections and it is very hard to navigate. There is no clear message in the section and none of the sections really addresses the main question (according to my guess) whether web driven learning is viable in the context of the task that the authors consider. The research questions that the authors want to answer in the section are not defined either, so it is really hard to understand the motivation behind ten different subsections of Section 5. I believe the authors themselves do not see the forest behind the trees and it is even worse for the reader.

In particular, I do not believe they use a large-scale web-based dataset as a base and then demonstrate successful transfer to another dataset.\n\n**A1**. The reviewer may misunderstand our paper. Actually we focus on learning from a set of clean data and transferring to another set of web data as claimed in Line 34-38 or Section 3, instead of learning from web data and transferring to other datasets. Specifically, we explore to learn novel categories from web data with the help of a set of base categories associated with clean data.\n\n---\n**Q2**. The experiments do not consider a real-life web dataset at all.\n\n**A2**. Actually, we conduct experiments on three real-life fine-grained datasets, including CUB [45], Car [45], and FGVC [19], as described at Section \"5.1 Datasets and Implementation\". We also conduct experiments on ImageNet as claimed in Line 241-242.\n\n---\n**Q3**. The experiments section has way too many subsections and it is very hard to navigate. \n\n**A3**. The major experiment is Section 5.5 demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed similarity transfer against baselines. We also introduce several important aspects to support our major finding and explore the proposed learning scenario, including the basic ablation study in Section 5.2, investigating our major idea \"similarity transfer\" in Section 5.3, analyzing robustness to several factors (Section 5.4, 5.7, 5.8, and 5.9), and a generalized setting in Section 5.10.",

    "comment": "**Q1**. It is not clear how the novel classes were chosen in the experiment.\n\n**A1**. The detailed base/novel splits are described in Line 27-29 of Appendix. Specifically, for CUB, we follow [11, 6], which is commonly used for zero/few-shot learning. For Car and FGVC, we randomly split base and novel categories by 3 : 1, following the split ratio in [11, 6]. There is no overlap between novel categories and ImageNet 1k categories, as claimed in Line 235-236.\n\n---\n\n**Q2**. The analysis does not give insights into performance of popular and rare classes. Web search of rare class will give more noisy results than popular classes.\n\n**A2**. Firstly, it is hard to formally define the popular and rare classes. One criterion may be the noise ratio of each class, but we have no ground-truth labels for novel classes from web search and thus we cannot examine the noisy ratio for each class in the real-world application. Another criterion may be the image number of each class from web search, but there are abundant web images for all novel classes. \n\nNevertheless, we try to employ the number of clean images in each novel class from the test set as the criterion (clean images from training set are not available for novel classes in our setting). The image numbers in CUB and FGVC datasets are balanced, so we only report for Car dataset. We group the novel categories as \"rare/moderate/popular\" three levels according to their image numbers in the test set, and summarize the results in Tab. 1 below. We can find that the overall performance of \"rare\" group is inferior to \"popular\" group, probably due to more noise in web training images. The performance gains on \"rare\" group and \"popular\" group of our method are comparable. \n\nIn addition, we also explore the impact of the noise ratio using synthetic noisy data to demonstrate the robustness of our setting and method in Section \"5.8 The Impact of the Noise Ratio in Web Images\".\n\n**Tab. 1**. Accuracies (%) of class groups of different popularity. The number of categories in \"rare/moderate/popular\" groups are equal, i.e., containing 36 categories. \"Fusion1\" and \"Fusion2\" are the short names for \"SOMNet+MetaBaseline\" and \"DivideMix+MetaBaseline\", which are the two most competitive baselines as descriped in Line 312-314.\n\n| Method | Rare | Moderate | Popular |\n :-: | :-: | :-:| :-:\n| Cls Loss | 79.5 | 80.6     | 85.3    |\n| Fusion1  | 82.9 | 83.2     | 89.6    |\n| Fusion2  | 83.4 | 84.5     | 89.0    |\n| Ours     | 86.0 | 86.8     | 92.3    |\n\n---\n**Q3**. Quality of search engines have been dramatically improving over the past few years. It is not clear if comparison with other webly supervised approaches was thus done fairly.\n\n**A3**. In this work, we run all methods using the same web data for fair comparison. The details of used web data can be found in Section \"2 Datasets\" in the Appendix.",

    "comment": "**Q1**: My major concern is also the motivation of the proposed setting. In my view, if we can obtain the weakly supervised data from the web and the label accuracy is not so bad, then it's easy and cheap to clean the web dataset (For example, utilizing crowdsourcing). Furthermore, for the application scenarios that truly need expert knowledge for human annotation such as intelligent medical, it's hard to collect the labeled data from the web.\n\n**A1**. According to previous literature on webly supervised learning [34, 39, 13, 44, 49], cleaning web data is very expensive , especially for fine-grained categories, because the difference between fine-grained categories is very subtle and annotating fine-grained categories is in high demand of expert knowledge [34, 39, 12, 31]. As for the availability of web data, it is mainly determined by the popularity of the data over web. Fine-grained categories of bird, car, and aircraft require expert knowledge, but there are abundant web images. For the images hard to obtain from web, it is the problem for all webly supervised learning methods [9, 15, 16, 31, 40], instead of the unique problem of our setting. \n\nOur setting is very close to that in [24], which also collects web images for novel categories as weak-labeled images and meanwhile leverage the clean images from base fine-grained categories. However, [24] further assumed the reliability of word vectors as well as the availability of unlabeled test images in the training stage. Thus, our setting is at least more practical than [24].\n\nBesides, similar weak-shot setting has been explored in object detection and segmentation. For the detection task, the setting named mixed supervised detection [*1, *2, *3] defines base categories as a set of categories having bounding box annotations and novel categories as another set of categories having only class labels. For the segmentation task [*4], the base categories are defined as a set of categories having instance segmentation mask annotations and novel categories are defined as another set of categories having only class labels. Anyway, all these works as well as ours focus on learning novel categories from cheap weak labels with the support of a set of base categories already having strong labels.\n\n[*1] Li, Yan, et al. \"Mixed supervised object detection with robust objectness transfer.\" IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence 41.3 (2018): 639-653.\n\n[*2] Zhong, Yuanyi, et al. \"Boosting weakly supervised object detection with progressive knowledge transfer.\" ECCV. 2020.\n\n[*3] Chen, Zitian, et al. \"Cross-Supervised Object Detection.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.15056 (2020).\n\n[*4] Kuo, Weicheng, et al. \"Shapemask: Learning to segment novel objects by refining shape priors.\" CVPR. 2019.\n\n---\n**Q2**: Another concern is the ImageNet pre-train. It is not a standard practice in zero-shot and few-shot learning. How about the performance without ImageNet pre-train? Is it fair to compare with the baseline methods? \n\n**A2**: Because the baselines of webly supervised learning [16, 9, 37] usually pre-train on ImageNet, we have to pre-train the backbones on ImageNet for all baselines considering the overall fairness. We also have carefully inspected our base/novel category split to ensure that there is no overlap between novel categories and ImageNet 1k categories.\n\n---\n**Q3**. The methodological novelty is limited\n\n**A3**. We acknowledge that the sample weighting and graph regularization have been widely used in previous literature but the key problem is how to use them in different tasks. We design our sample weighting and graph regularization based on the proposed cross-category similarity transfer, which is distinctive from previous works and well-tailored for the new weak-shot setting. Furthermore, since this is the first method in this new setting, we believe that it is not a drawback to make the proposed method simple and effective.\n",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the comments, and for carefully checking the proof. We answer the reviewer's questions in the following.\n\n**1. Why should we consider higher moments for linear stability? E.g., why second order is not sufficient to say that a minimum is stable? If a minimum is not stable for some order but is stable in a lower order, what this tells us? Can a minimum be stable for any order? if so, does it have special properties?**\n\n**response**: There are at least two benefits to consider the stability of higher moments. First, the stability of higher moments is stronger than the stability of lower moments, instead of being equivalent. For a minimum that is stable for higher moments, the distribution of the iterators is more concentrated around the global minimum. For example, if the minimum is second order stable, the second moment of the iterator's distribution is bounded, but its higher moments can go to infinity, and the trajectory of iterators may have an unbounded subsequence. If a minimum is stable for any order, then the trajectory lies in a bounded set. Second, by Theorem 3, 4, and 6, higher order stability leads to better bounds on Sobolev seminorm and generalization error. Especially, the order of stability influences the order of $n$ in the generalization error, which is a crucial term in the bounds. With a fixed data distribution, the generalization error decreases faster when the minimum is stable with higher order moments.\n\n**2. The bounds proved by the multiplicative property, namely Theorem 4-7, can be loose. For example, consider the simple case of a two-layer univariate network with ReLU activation (i.e. scalar input/output with a wide hidden layer). Since ReLU is positive homogenous we can arbitrarily increase the $l_p$-norm of the first layer while preserving the function implemented by the network, and thus making the bounds trivial. This is true for any network with ReLU activation (or its variants).**\n\n**response**: By the homogeneity of ReLU activation, one can indeed make the input layer parameters arbitrarily large while not changing the function implemented by the model. However, this is unlikely to happen in practice, especially for the trajectories produced by SGD. For ReLU network trained with SGD, there is an invariant involving weights from neighboring layers [1]. This guarantees that the weights from all layers get big or small at the same time. As long as the initialization is good, it is unlikely that one layer becomes very big while another becomes very small. Please also see our response to Reviewer 3 for more discussion on this issue, as well as some numerical results.\n\n**3. From 2, it is not true to say that SGD implicitly regulate the Sobolev semi-norm of the function implemented by the network, since there is no (proven) mechanism in SGD that keeps the the norm of the first layer small.**\n\n**response**: By the discussion for point (2), at least for ReLU network, SGD can indeed keep the input layer parameters from getting excessively large. Yet, we agree that before obtaining a rigorous proof of SGD's control on first-layer parameters, it is better to say SGD stability and small first layer parameters regulate the Sobolev semi-norm together. Within the two factors, we want to emphasize the significant role played by SGD stability. To be precise, we will change the paper's title to \"The Connection Between Linear Stability of SGD and the Smoothness of Neural Networks as a Function of Input Data\". \n\n**4. The authors claim that Corollary 3 is more accurate than previous known result, which is written in Proposition 1 (see row 235), however I did not see any explanation nor proof for this claim (maybe I have missed it...).**\n\n**response**: To avoid overclaiming, we will change the sentence \"we can write down a more accurate sufficient condition for linear stability than Proposition 1\" to \"we can write down another sufficient condition for linear stability\". Though, we believe the condition in Corollary 3 is more accurate than that in Proposition 1, because the former one is derived directly from a closed dynamics of $\\mathbb{E} \\tilde{W}_t^{\\otimes 2}$. We will leave the study of the two sufficient conditions' relation to future work.\n\n**5. Most of the results hold only for the quadratic loss.**\n\n**response**: We agree that most of our analysis are conducted on square loss. We believe that similar results will hold on other strongly convex losses, which have no essential difference from the square loss. Though, our analysis may not directly apply on the cross entropy loss. The biggest difference for the cross entropy loss is that the global minima of the cross entropy loss are usually infinitely big. Hence, one have to consider directions as minimum instead of points. We leave detailed analysis as future work. \n\n**6. I think that Lemma 1 is used to prove necessity in the proof of Theorem 1, and not sufficiency.**\n\n**response**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, Lemma 1 is only used in the proof  ofnecessity. In the revised version of the paper, we will move this Lemma after the proof of sufficiency. \n\n[1] Arora, Sanjeev, Nadav Cohen, and Elad Hazan. \"On the optimization of deep networks: Implicit acceleration by overparameterization.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

Can the author extend on the assumption that the input layer weights are not very large?  **Answer:** We conducted preliminary experiments concerning the first layer weights. Results show that usually the first layer weights do not get very big. It increases at the early phase of the training, but gets stable afterwards (e.g. after $20000$ iterations). Please see the following table for some results. \n\n|n_iters | 0 | 100 | 1000 | 10000 | 20000 | 50000 |\n|----------|---|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|\n|$\\|\\|W_1\\|\\|_2$ | 1.032 | 1.034 | 1.218 | 2.011 | 2.257 | 2.270 |\n\nThe table shows the norm of first layer parameter matrix at different iterations. We train a fully-connected neural network on FashionMNIST. The experiment settings are the same as the experiments in the paper. The results are averages from 5 runs.\nWe will do more experiments and add some discussion on this issue in the revised version of the paper. Theoretical insights also exist. For example, for fully-connected ReLU networks trained with SGD there is an invariant between parameters from neighboring layers (Similar to that in [1]). This imposes a balance between all the layers and prevents parameters of a single layer from getting too big. \n\n[1] Arora, Sanjeev, Nadav Cohen, and Elad Hazan. \"On the optimization of deep networks: Implicit acceleration by overparameterization.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable questions and comments. We apologize for the confusion caused by the typos, especially the one on the title. We will carefully read through the whole paper and correct all typos. \n\nFor the questions raised by the reviewer:\n\n**1. It is not clear how restrictive the assumptions the paper makes. It would be clarifying to explain if these assumptions are true for deep neural networks.**\n\n**response**: Our assumptions lie in two categories: assumptions on data and assumptions on networks. We have one assumption on neural networks: the local smoothness condition (definition 1). This condition is actually weaker than second-order smoothness, since we only require the gradient (with respect to $W$) be bounded around the global minimum. Therefore, this assumption holds locally in a neighborhood around the global minimum as long as the network function is second-order differentiable. We do not provide the size of the neighborhood, since there is no good tool to derive non-vacuous bounds for neural networks' derivatives. \n\nThe other assumptions like those in Definition 2, 3, and 4 are for the distribution of input data. These assumptions usually hold for distribution supported on low-dimensional surfaces. Practical datasets for neural networks are widely believed to lie on low dimensional sets. Works have been done to explore the intrinsic dimension of image datasets [1]. However, since we do not know the exact distribution of real data, it is not easy to precisely verify the assumptions made in our paper on real data. \n\n**2.The product structure has been shown that holds for MLP. Does it hold for other architectures such as CNN or transformers?**\n\n**response**: The product structure holds as long as the input vector is first multiplied with a parameter matrix before any other nonlinear operation. It holds for nearly all popular network structures. A convolution is a linear transformation for tensors. If we vectorize the input images, then the convolution becomes a product of the vectorized input with a parameter matrix. The parameter matrix has some special structures, such as parameter sharing. But the product structure between the input data and the parameter matrix still holds. This is also true for ResNets, DenseNets, RNNs (LSTMs), and even Transformers, which all involves a direct linear transformation on the input data (in the forms of simple linear transformations, convolutions or attentions). Besides, experimental results in the paper (on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) also show that our results hold numerically for CNN.\n\n\n**3.In practice we usually normalize the data, therefore some $x_i$ could be very close to zero. Based on this, how tight do you think the upper bound in 4 could be?**\n\n**response**: If the normalization is done element-wise, then it is possible that some data will become very small after normalization. These data have close-to-average values on every entry. These data can make some of our bounds loose, such as the bounds in Theorem 3, 4, and 6. However, such small data is only a very small portion of all data, and the portion gets exponentially smaller as the dimension increases. Therefore, when the input dimension is big, we can just ignore these data in our bounds, and only consider data whose norms are big enough. For example, in Theorem 6 we can put the small data (and their neighborhood) into the last term in the bound, which characterizes a small portion of space that is not covered by the estimate of Sobolev seminorm. \n\nIf the normalization is done point-wise, i.e. normalize each data point to have norm 1 (this is assumed in many theoretical work), then the normalization will not have negative impact to our bounds. On the contrary, it prevents the data from being too small.\n\n\n**4.You assume that SGD with fixed step size would converge to an interpolating solution. It would be helpful to explain under which condition this can happen and why you think MLP satisfies these requirements.**\n\n**response**: There are both numerical and theoretical evidence that over-parameterized neural networks can fit all the training data and find interpolating solutions during training. Numerical observations that neural network can reduce training error to zero are provided in many works, such as [2]. Theoretical analysis are provided in the highly over-parameterized cases, such as the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime [3]. The puzzle is that neural networks can still generalize well when they are over-parameterized and can easily fit all the training data. Our work provide an explanation to this puzzle by identifying an implicit regularization effect of SGD. \n\n\n[1] Pope, Phillip, et al. \"The Intrinsic Dimension of Images and Its Impact on Learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.08894 (2021).\n\n[2] Zhang, Chiyuan, et al. \"Understanding deep learning (still) requires rethinking generalization.\" Communications of the ACM 64.3 (2021): 107-115.\n\n[3] Jacot, Arthur, Franck Gabriel, and Cl\u00e9ment Hongler. \"Neural tangent kernel: Convergence and generalization in neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.07572 (2018).",

    "review": "Overall, I feel that the viewpoint presented in this work is novel and worthy of publication. The key insight is that since the input $x$ and the neural network weights are first multiplied and then entered into the network, so regularity (stability) properties on $W$ can be transferred onto regularity (wideness/small Sobolev norm) properties with respect to $x$ is a very nice one.\n\nI have one not-so-minor comment. Definition 5 seems to be incomplete; the relation between $W^*$ and $\\tilde{W}^{\\otimes k}_t$ is not completely specified. (All that is said is that $\\{W_t\\}$ is close to $W^*$.) I think the issue is that the authors have the mental model of an interpolating global minimum as an isolated minimum. However, there is some recent evidence that a connected set of global minima is a more accurate model.\nhttps://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/be3087e74e9100d4bc4c6268cdbe8456-Abstract.html\nhttp://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/shevchenko20a.html\nCan the authors comment on how having a connected set of interpolating global minima may or may not affect the analysis?",
    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the appreciation of the insight provided in our paper. For the reviewer's question on Definition 5, we would like to point out that this definition only involves the linearized dynamics of $\\tilde{W}_t$, and therefore we do not need to assume $\\tilde{W}_0$ is close to $W^*$. An issue is how well is the quadratic approximation to the actual landscape, and equivalently how well does the linearized dynamics approximate the real dynamics. We believe this is also the reviewer's main problem. We did not provide an estimate of the size of the neighborhood in which this approximation works well. Though, by the Taylor's theorem, quadratic approximation always holds locally as long as the loss function is twice differentiable, no matter it is locally convex or not. Therefore, even for the case where interpolating global minima are connected and hence local landscape is nonconvex, around a sufficiently small neighborhood of (any) global minima the quadratic approximation of the loss function still holds. As a consequence, any optimization dynamics that converges to a global minima $W^*$ has to satisfy the linear stability condition given in Definition 5 (with respect to this specific $W^*$). ",

    "review": "Given that transfer learning is of great importance in machine learning, the task of compressing data only for certain downstream tasks is definitely worth exploring. However, though the paper made a good effort to formulate this problem, I think the experiments used in the paper might be insufficient to demonstrate the effect of their proposed technique \u2014 performing data augmentation during training leads to better lossy compressors:\n\n - The author claimed in the introduction that they aim to \u201censure good performance on any future tasks of interest\u201d. This setup was only tested in the CLIP experiment in Section 5.3, where the authors trained a compressor and validated on 8 datasets unseen during training. However, the good results may simply come from the fact that the latent representations of CLIP (a large pre-trained model analogous to BERT) already have a low bit-rate. That is, training any lossy compressor with the latent representations as input could lead to similar rate gains.\n\nTo address this concern, I would recommend the authors to at least compare the bit-rate also with other modern lossy compressors trained on latent representations generated by CLIP. It would also be great if the authors to demonstrate the performance gain provided by different data-augmentation techniques. In general, only comparing with JPEG does not provide useful information about how good the proposed model is since the goal of JPEG is to compress images while not changing its visual appearance by too much.\n\n - Need to justify the proposed models is not simply compressing the labels. For example, in the experiment in Section 5.2, performance drop and compression gain are compared. However, even by simply compressing the labels, one can get zero decreases in test accuracy and achieve a much better compression gain. The proposed models (VIC, BINCE) are of course not doing this explicitly. However, I am a bit concerned that this could be accidentally done implicitly. For example, consider an MLP with hidden layer size 32 - 16 - 8. If the bottleneck is set at the layer with 32 hidden neurons, the bit-rate could be worse than when the bottleneck is set at the last layer (8 hidden neurons). \n\nI think the authors should design a better evaluation metric to avoid the above trivial case.\n\n - Overall, I like the high-level idea of the paper, but it seems hard for me to separate the cause of the bit-rate gain: is it caused by the good latent representations learned by SSL models, or the proposed invariant compression technique plays a critical role there? For example, if we have a powerful SSL model trained to classify ImageNet samples, then CIFAR10 can be faithfully solved only by looking at the 1000-class imagenet label.

This was not our contribution, and any entropy model and quantizer that works for neural compressors should work for us. We now provided more details in the paper.\n\n> the Appendix describes the quantizer process with a linear transformation using the learnable parameter.\n\nThe linear transformation is only used in our pretrained CLIP experiments in Sec. 5.3. We had to do so because Balle\u2019s entropy model quantizes the input by rounding to the nearest integer.

    "review": "Strength\nThis paper considers solving the inverse problem with a quadratic regularizer (generalized Tikhonov regularization). The problem is formulated rigorously in the context of functionals. There are two parts of theoretical results provided by this paper.  Firstly, it shows that the optimal shifting and scaling parameters in the regularizer should be the mean and covariance of the true signal distribution. Secondly, when the distribution is not available, the paper suggests two ways to learn those parameters from data and provides upper bounds for the excess risk. The results are verified through experiments. \n\nWeakness\n1. The paper shows the optimal parameters for the regularizer are the mean and covariance. By plugging them into the objective, it reduces to the objective of MAP, up to a scalar factor. It would be better to discuss this connection in the paper.\n2. Theorem 4.1 relies on the assumption (a), which introduces another Hilbert space H and corresponding maps j1 and j2. It seems unnatural and abstract to me to introduce those notations even for the purpose of bounding covering numbers. It would be better to discuss how this assumption fits into the practice. \n3. It is interesting that the unsupervised method outperforms the supervised one in terms of both theory and simulation. Considering that the supervised method requires additional data of y and more computation, the value of using the supervised method is further decreased. The information from y or the error seems unnecessary in estimating h and B, while the paper doesn't provide any discussion on this.\n4. In the numerical analysis, the paper only considers a simple case where A=I. That seems not enough since A is really an important component of the inverse problem. The experiments with a more general A are necessary and helpful in justifying the theoretical results.\n\n\n---- after rebuttal ----\n\nI appreciate the author's feedback. After reading the response and other reviews, I would like to keep my rating for this paper.",
    "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for the positive feedback and the useful comments and suggestions. We address all of them below.\n\n1. This is indeed an important point, we will mention this connection in the remarks after Theorem 3.1. We remark that, in a Bayesian framework, the interpretation of the optimal Tikhonov regularizer as a MAP estimator is only valid for Gaussian random variables, whereas the result we propose in Section 3 is valid for a larger class of random variables and processes. We propose to add also the references [Gribonval, IEEE Trans. Signal Process. 2011] and [Gribonval-Machart, NIPS 2013], which discuss the connection of MAP estimation and non-quadratic variational regularization.\n2. We propose to add the following example about assumption a) at the root of  Theorem 4.1. When $H$ and $X$ are Sobolev spaces of periodic functions, $H=H^{\\sigma_1}(\\mathbb{T}^1)$ and $X=H^{\\sigma_2}(\\mathbb{T}^1)$ the assumption that $j_1:H\\to X$ satisfies assumption a) is just that $\\sigma_1>\\sigma_2$. Thus, assumption a) is typically satisfied in most imaging applications. In rough terms, it is analogous to assuming that the measured signal is smoother than the white noise measurement error. A similar argument applies to $B^\\star$. It is worth observing that smoothness assumptions are very common in machine learning in order to obtain explicit bounds, see  [Blanchard-M\u00fccke, FoCM, 2018] and references therein. We will add a sentence explaining the meaning of such assumption, and add the quoted reference.  \n3. This is a very relevant consideration that can be derived from our work. It was already briefly mentioned at the beginning of Section 4.2, but without referring to the (not yet available) generalization bounds.  We will certainly extend this discussion and add a brief comment on this aspect in the conclusions.\n4. We implemented also the case of ill-posed operators, and in particular of operators whose singular values decay polynomially. In the outcome of the experiments, we observe the same decay of the excess risk as in the denoising case, up to different constants. We propose to include the related numerical results and a comment in a new Appendix A.8.",

    "review": "The main results of the paper are a generalization of well known results in finite dimensions to an infinite-dimensional settings.\nThe main ideas which underlies the proofs are also derived from the finite dimensional setting. \nE.g, in order to find the LMMSE, the authors equate the Gateaux derivative to 0, instead of the 'regular' derivative, as is done in the classical proofs.\nIn this respect, the results are not surprising and perhaps, one could claim, are not very exciting.\n\nHowever, as the authors demonstrate, the move to infinite-dimensions has many technical difficulties and is a highly non-trivial task.\nSpecial care must be taken when discussing the type of spaces involved in the problem, the type of linear operator between those spaces and even the form of admissible randomness. Indeed, even the correct formulation of the problem is not immediate, since in general one should not expect $A$ to have a bounded inverse. \n\nThe paper is well written, and the authors do a rather good job in motivating the formulation of the problem and the definitions. The math itself is very elegant and it could even prove useful for other, similar, problems. I think it can fit well with the theme of conference.\n\nHaving said the above, I do feel that the style and presentation of the paper could be improved. I add some concrete suggestions/comments below:\n\n- Above all, I feel that the analogy to the finite-dimensional case is important and is not highlighted enough in the paper. Some of the results obtained in the paper transform into simple exercises in optimization, when one considers well posed problems in finite dimensions. In my opinion, it would be beneficial to show (or atleast state) those proofs in the paper, followed by a discussion of the technical difficulties which arise when one moves to infinite dimensions.\n\n- I can appreciate nice math, hence my score. However, in the broader scope of the field, if possible, I would be happy for some motivating examples where one would actually want to consider the specific problems introduced in the paper. The authors mention denoising, deblurring, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. As far as I understand none  of those examples is both 'infinite-dimensional' and 'linear'. Can the authors comment on this point?\n\n- Line 53: Presumably one also wants for the noise $\\varepsilon$ to be independent of $x$. I think this is also used later on.\n\n- Line 109: After reading Examples 2.3 I do not feel like I understand the problem better. I mean, Example 2.2 is kind of canonical, so it's nice to keep in mind, but I am not sure what purpose Example 2.3 is supposed to achieve.\nI can say the same about Example 2.6. However, this is a matter of personal taste and I leave it to the authors discretion.\n\n- Line 123: I feel that Remark 2.5 is very important and actually fundamental to the paper. Why is only a remark and not an actual part of formulating the problem? (Again, this is a matter of personal taste).\n\n- Line 126: I do not understand the comment that $K$ is not identified with $K^*$. In general, those are not isomorphic spaces and cannot be identified. The same comment repeats again, later in the paper.\n\n- Line 129: Shouldn't it be $v \\in K$?\n\n- Line 151: Since $v \\in K$. I think $\\langle Ax, v \\rangle_Y$ should be $\\langle Ax, \\iota(v) \\rangle_Y$. It's ok to omit the embedding, when it's clear from the context, but this has to be stated somewhere and it would help the readability if it would be consistent throughout the paper.\n\n- Line 161: \"to be at least as smoothing\". This sentence is too vague. I feel that saying something concrete would be more helpful for the reader here.\n\n- Line 164: I tried to understand why the main result is constrained to a linear map between Hilbert spaces, rather than, say, Banach spaces. As far as I see, the display beneath Line 164, where the authors expand the error, is the main reason for that. Can the authors comment on that? If this is so, it might be worthwhile to add a small discussion on this point.\n\n- Line 187: \"The optimal h^*\". As will be shown in Theorem 3.1, there could be more than optimal $h$. The word 'the' is then not appropriate here.\n\n- Line 190: It would be to have all assumptions written together in one place.\n\n- Display beneath Line 194: It's not very common to write \"A = B in some subspace\". I think that using a restriction sign \"|\" or just a projection operator would be more familiar.\n\n- Line 232: The quantity in this line is first defined as $\\rho_1$ but treated as a different letter in the following display. (Embarrassingly, I am not sure what is the other letter. Perhaps it is a different font of \\rho?).\n\n- Display beneath Line 232: The notation $\\mathrm{HS}\\left(\\cdot, \\cdot\\right)$ was not properly defined. Presumably, it means the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. However, later in the Appendix a different notation is also used for this space ($\\mathcal{L}_{HS}$), which might create some confusions.\n\nLine 271: I am not sure whether I agree with the statement in this line. The authors show that the strategies are equivalent when $s' \\to \\infty$, which seems like a degenerate case. Perhaps the authors mean to think about $s$ as being largish and then say that for any 'reasonable' $m$ the two bounds are close? Anyways, I would be happy for a clarification. To me, it seems that the 'unsupervised' method is superior (which is supported by the experiments).\n\nLine 325: \"e.g. with deep learning methods\". I am not sure I see the connections. Again, would be happy for a clarification.\n\nAppendix A.1: On one hand, I am happy that the authors added this appendix. It supplies some intuition, definitions and examples. On the other hand, I'm not sure what purpose it actually serves since all the necessary material was presented in the main paper and this appendix was never referenced in the main text.\n\nProposition A.2: As far as I can see, these are just the same assumptions, used before. This brings me back to the suggestion of having one place to gather all assumptions.\n\nLine 552: what do you mean by independence of $x$ and $\\mu$? $\\mu$ is deterministic.\n\nLine 558: \"such functional\" -> \"such a functional\"\n\n\n\n",
    "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for the positive feedback and the many useful comments and suggestions. We address all of them below.\n\n- **Analogy to the finite-dimensional case.** We agree, a detailed comparison with the corresponding result of Section 3 in the finite-dimensional case would certainly be very useful and beneficial, but unfortunately would not fit the page limit of the manuscript. We decided only to point out a very precise reference  [17, Theorem 12.1] in line 209. We would like also to point out that the analogy is limited to the result of Section 3, and the generalization bounds of Section 4 are new also in the finite-dimensional case.\n- **Motivating examples.** In the inverse problems (theoretical) literature it is indeed common to consider a continuous formulation of the mentioned problems via integral operators in infinite-dimensional spaces, in which the signals are modeled by functions on a continuous domain. For this purpose, we will more carefully add pointers to relevant references for each reported application, such as the book [Hanke-Engl-Neubauer, Regularization of inverse problems] for denoising and deblurring, [Natterer, The mathematics of Computerized Tomography] for CT and [Epstein, Introduction to the Mathematics of Medical Imaging] for MRI. Those references should also help to clarify the linear nature of such inverse problems.\n- **Line 53.** We will clarify that $x$ and $\\varepsilon$ are independent also in the introduction, at the end of line 52.\n- **Line 109.** The purpose of Example 2.3 is to show, in a particular case, the link between the prior on $x$ and the covariance operator $\\Sigma_x$ in a classical setting with a smoothing prior. Unfortunately, the space limit does not allow us to expand this discussion. Example 2.6 has the simple aim of showing that, in the case when $\\varepsilon$ is a random variable (and not only a process), the rather complicated construction of Remark 2.5 may be avoided.\n- **Line 123.** We completely agree that the content of Remark 2.5 is fundamental and should not be seen as a side comment. However, the current formulation in a remark allows us to refer to it more easily in the rest of the paper, which is why we decided to use this environment.\n- **Line 126.**  Since $K$ is a Hilbert space, thanks to the Riesz representation theorem one may identify $K$ with its dual $K^*$. However, using the Gel'fand triple formalism, it is preferable to avoid this identification. For instance, in the Sobolev class, one usually identifies the dual of $L^2$ with itself, but the dual of $H^1$, which is a proper subspace of $L^2$, is not identified with $H^1$ and is denoted by $H^{-1}$, so that $L^2$ can be identified with a proper subset of $H^{-1}$, yielding the Gel'fand triple $H^1\\subset L^2\\subset H^{-1}$.\n- **Line 129.** Yes, we will fix the typo in the revision.\n- **Line 151.** Thanks, we will add $\\iota(v)$ in the revision.\n- **Line 161.** Unfortunately, it is not easy to say something more concrete in the general case. In the case when $AB$ and $\\Sigma_\\varepsilon\\iota$ are simultaneously diagonalizable, this condition means that the singular values of  $AB$ should go to $0$ at least as fast as the singular values of $\\Sigma_\\varepsilon\\iota$. If in the revised version we have enough space, we will add this explanation to clarify the initial comment. \n- **Line 164.** We are surely interested in the extension to Banach spaces (which would take into account $\\ell^1$ optimization, as mentioned in the third paragraph of Section 6). By now, we deeply rely on the Hilbert space structure, not only for the expansion in line 164 but also for the Gel'fand triple construction, the expression of the quadratic functional, and the properties of the covering numbers.\n- **Line 187.** This is true, in the revised version we will rephrase this sentence to clarify that the optimal parameters are not necessarily unique.\n- **Line 190.** We agree that it would be useful to have the assumptions in one single place. However, we decided to state the assumptions along the way, while the various ingredients were introduced, in order to preserve the flow of the paper. If there is enough space in the revised version, we will add a summary of the assumptions at the beginning of Section 3.\n- **Line 194.** This is true, we will change the notation in the revision.\n- **Line 232.** Thanks, this is a typo: we will correct it. We decided to use $\\varrho_1$ because $\\rho$ was already used to denote the joint probability distribution.\n- **Line 232.** Yes, this denotes the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators indeed. In the revision, we will make the notation uniform and mention the meaning in line 233.\n- **Line 271.** Yes, your interpretation is correct, and we agree that the statement in line 271 is not completely correct as it is stated. Since it is just a (not precise) rewording of what is mentioned before, we propose to remove the sentence in line 271 in the revision.\n- **Line 325.** We agree that this is not clear: we were referring to the approaches where the penalty term in the regularization functional is given by a (learned) neural network, as in [19,20,24,25,26]. We will cite these references here to clarify the connection.\n- **Appendix A.1.** It is true that all the basic concepts related to random processes were already presented in section 2. However, since random processes may not be familiar to everyone, we decided to add some discussion and details in the appendix. We forgot to mention the appendix in the main body: we will add a reference in line 121: \"The reader is referred to [11] and to Appendix A.1...\".\n- **Proposition A.2.** Yes, absolutely, these are the same assumptions used before, and are reported here for the reader's convenience. As mentioned above, we did not find it easy to put all the assumptions in the same place.\n- **Line 552.** This is a typo: $x$ and $\\varepsilon$ are independent.\n- **Line 558.** Thanks for noticing, we will fix this in the revision.",

    "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for the positive feedback and the useful comments and suggestions. We address all of them below.\n\n**Originality:**\n\nThe rate we obtain can be meaningfully compared with what is found in supervised learning: we refer to the recent results [Blanchard-M\u00fccke, FoCM, 2018] and [Lin-Rudi-Rosasco-Cevher, ACHA, 2020] and references therein. We propose to add these references, together with a short discussion, in Section 4. We moreover point out that we are not aware of papers related to learning a regularizer that address the theoretical questions considered in our manuscript such as generalization bounds.\n\n**Quality:**\n\nIn the proposed framework,  large values of $s$ mean that the compact embedding $H\\hookrightarrow X$ has rapidly decaying singular values, which is satisfied e.g. when $H$ is a space of much smoother functions with respect to $X$ (see lines 250-252): the larger $s$ is, the smoother the functions in $H$ are. In the context of inverse problems, this is directly connected with the regularity we can  *a priori* assume on the solution $x$. Indeed, as specified by assumption b) at line 237, we need to assume that the optimal parameter $h^\\star$ is an element of $H$, and similarly for $B^\\star$. Nevertheless, this kind of *a priori* smoothness assumption on the unknown solution $x$ is rather common in inverse problems as well as in machine learning. We propose to add a comment after the assumptions in Section 4.1 to discuss what it means to have a large $s$.\nMoreover, we have also run additional numerical tests in the case of ill-posed operators, and in particular when the singular values of the operator $A$ decay polynomially. In the outcome of the experiments, we observe the same decay of the excess risk as in the denoising case, up to different constants. We propose to include the related numerical results and a comment in a new Appendix A.8.\nWe agree with the referee that it is intriguing that the regularisation parameter does not depend on the level of ill-posedness of the inverse problem, but only on the prior on $x$ (this happens because optimality is measured by averaging over $x$ and $\\varepsilon$, and not with a fixed datum).  This was already well-known in finite dimension (line 209), and our result generalizes this important fact to the infinite-dimensional case.\n\n**Clarity:**\n\nThroughout the simulations, we consider a noise level of $5$\\% (namely, the standard deviation of the noise is $5$\\% of the peak value of the signal). We will add this information to the paper. The discrepancy between 64 and 256 may be due to numerical instabilities, especially for small $m$. We reserve to discuss it in following work. Finally, $c \\in K$ at line 129 is a typo, which should be corrected to $v \\in K$.",

    "comment": "We are grateful to the reviewer for the insightful comments, which point out important aspects of our paper. In the following, we hope to provide a satisfactory answer to the issues raised by the review. \n\n1.  Many inverse problems are by their own nature infinite-dimensional. In real applications, their reduction to a finite-dimensional problem is mainly due to computational reasons, and the discretization step always introduces an error. Hence, it is of main interest to provide a genuine theoretical analysis in an infinite-dimensional setting, allowing, as a by-product, to bound the discretization error.  Examples of such frameworks are: to solve partial differential equations using finite element methods, medical tomography where the artifacts and ghost images are explained using integral geometry, to solve stochastic differential equations in mathematical finance by It\u00f4-calculus. Note that the properties of the infinite-dimensional inverse problems have been shown to lead to convergence of the solutions only in a low regularity space [Kekkonen-Lassas-Siltanen, Inverse problems 2016] as the dimension of the approximated model goes to infinity. Other relevant references discussing the importance of modeling inverse problems directly in infinite dimensions are [16,30] and [Monard-Nickl-Paternain, CPAM 2021]. In recent years, much research has been done also on machine learning for functions between infinite-dimensional spaces, see [9,22,31], [Parhi-Nowak, JMLR, 2021]. For example, the work of A. Stuart's group on neural operators is an infinite-dimensional generalization on neural networks displaying genuinely new features, see e.g. [Nelsen-Stuart, arxiv 2020] and [Li et al., ICLR 2021]. According to these considerations, we thus believe that the infinite-dimensional framework considered in our manuscript has solid motivations and we propose to include (part of) this discussion in Section 1.\nWe agree with the reviewer that the statements of our results are closely related to their finite-dimensional counter-part, however, the assumptions and the proofs are very different. For example, we need to consider random processes, to introduce Gel'fand triples, to modify the objective function, compare (10) with (11). Furthermore, we need to assume Assumption 2.8, which is new and at the root of our proofs. We also would like to point out that the generalization bounds provided in Section 4 are, to the best of our knowledge, new also in a finite-dimensional context. \n2. We chose the proposed title trying to balance a rigorous and precise description of our work and the desire to avoid technical expressions. We are nevertheless open to discuss it and modify it. Following the fair criticism of the reviewer, a possible updated title could be *Learning the optimal Tikhonov regularizer for inverse problems*.\nWe are moreover happy to add references to results in the literature regarding optimal (non-quadratic) regularizers associated with different priors, e.g. [Gribonval, IEEE Trans. Signal Process. 2011], [Gribonval-Machart, NIPS 2013] and [Burger-Lucka, Inverse Problems 2014], which always deal with a finite-dimensional setting (we would be happy to hear about other references we are not aware of). We plan to cite them in the third paragraph of Section 6 and we plan to add a comment about the relation with our contribution.",

    "review": "Pros:\n\n+ Writing: This paper is well written and easy to follow. The overall paper is well-organized. Figures and Tables are clear to show the methods and comparisons.\n\n+ Novelty: This paper considers an interesting problem, i.e., novel class discovery. In addition, a fine-grained setting is introduced in this paper, which is not studied in previous NCD works. For the method, this paper introduces two simple but effective approaches, which explicitly take the advantage of both the global and local factors and obtain consistent improvement.\n\n+ Experiments: This paper presents extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of the components of the proposed method. The comparisons with other methods are comprehensive and fair. In addition, the authors also provide the experiments on more difficult settings: unknown number of novel classes and open-set unlabeled data.\n\nCons/Concerns:\n\nI have some questions about the method and the experiment.\n\n- Did you use the proposed losses for the labeled data, especially the local loss? If no, how about the results of using them for the labeled data. Will this improve the discrimination of the representation?\n\n- For the part dictionary memory bank, why not save all the parts of a sample into the memory? Could you provide the difference between using a random part of a sample and using all parts of a sample?  \n\n- Saving random/all part features into the memory is a bit wild? Is it possible to first find high-response regions (for example the activations) and only save them into the memory? \n\n- The proposed has two branches, which one is used for the testing stage? With JSD loss, I think these two branches may have similar results. However, when removing JSD loss, which one is used? \n\n- In Table 6, it seems that a larger memory size brings higher results. Why not using the larger memory size for all other experiments? Will it lead to a very large computation cost?\n\n- For the self-pretraining, how about the results of removing the self-pretraining? In addition, why use RotationNet for CIFAR while MOCOV2 for others? How about the results of using RotationNet/MOCO for others/CIFAR?\n\n- Which dataset is evaluated in Table 1 of Supple. Is it CIFAR-100?\n\n- Open questions: (1) In the open-set setting (Table 1 of Supple), did you use any technique to recognize the samples of known and unseen classes? If no, will the model assign all the samples to the known classes and give very few values/probabilities to the novel classes? (2) It would be nice that the authors can provide a visualization for the local comparison process. For example, we save many local features in the memory bank, when computing the similarity between each part of a sample and parts in the memory, we visualize the image rejoins of corresponding highly ranked parts. \n\nOverall, this paper considers an interesting problem and presents a novel and effective approach, which achieves the SOTA results. During rebuttal, please mainly answer the first 7 concerns. The authors can also selectively provide more discussions and visualizations for the open questions.\n\n**Post Rebuttal** After reading the response of the authors, my concerns are well-addressed. I also read the comments of other reviewers and I agree with them that this paper presents a novel approach for novel class discovery. Thus, I decided to keep my original rating and tend to give 'accept' to this paper.\n\n",
    "comment": "> Q1: Did you use the proposed losses for the labeled data, especially the local loss? If no, how about the results of using them for the labeled data. Will this improve the discrimination of the representation?\n> \n> A1: We use the same losses (CE, BCE, sKLD) for both branches. For each branch, CE is used on labeled data, BCE is on unlabeled data, and sKLD is on both labelled and unlabelled data, so that we can make the best use of data for training. Our local branch only uses part comparison for pairwise pseudo label generation, while the losses are the same with the global branch and are applied for both labelled and unlabelled data.\n\n> Q2: For the part dictionary memory bank, why not save all the parts of a sample into the memory? Could you provide the difference between using a random part of a sample and using all parts of a sample?\n> \n> A2: Thanks for the suggestion. We have experimented using all parts of a sample into the part dictionary on CUB-200, and the ACC is 46.5, which is slightly lower than using only a random part (i.e. 47.8), we suspect that this is because using all parts will make the part dictionary redundant with many similar parts, and thus the performance of local comparison may be degraded due to less informative parts. \n\n> Q3: Saving random/all part features into the memory is a bit wild? Is it possible to first find high-response regions (for example the activations) and only save them into the memory?\n> \n> A3: Thanks for the helpful suggestion. In the submission, we used the random part for simplicity. Here, we experimented using only the highest response part into the part dictionary. The highest response region is selected using the method proposed in [A].  We obtain an improved ACC of 48.5 on the CUB-200 dataset. We will run experiments on other datasets and report the corresponding results in our final version. \n\n> Q4: The proposed has two branches, which one is used for the testing stage? With JSD loss, I think these two branches may have similar results. However, when removing JSD loss, which one is used?\n> \n> A4: (1) We simply use the global branch for testing, because with JSD loss, the two branches agree with each other after training. (2) For testing, we can drop the local branch and the three memory banks, leaving the global branch as the simplest model for testing. (3) For the experiment without JSD, we also simply use the global branch for testing.\n\n> Q5: In Table 6, it seems that a larger memory size brings higher results. Why not using the larger memory size for all other experiments? Will it lead to a very large computation cost?\n> \n> A5: In Table 6, we show that the performance can be further improved for practitioners who have enough computation and memory resources by using a larger bank size. However, the improvement of a larger memory bank compared to the additional computation and memory cost is not substantial. Hence, we simply use the relatively small number of 2048 for computational efficiency.\n\n> Q6: For the self-pretraining, how about the results of removing the self-pretraining? In addition, why use RotationNet for CIFAR while MOCOV2 for others? How about the results of using RotationNet/MOCO for others/CIFAR?\n> \n> A6: Indeed, we have already reported results without self-supervised pretraining in row 5 of Table 4 in our submission. The numbers are reasonably good, but consistently worse than those with self-supervised pretraining. We use RotNet for CIFAR for a fair comparison with previous methods. The usage of MoCoV2 on other datasets is for a better baseline performance on the new datasets we experimented in our paper. We have experimented using RotNet pretraining on CUB-200 and Stanford-Cars, the cluster acc are 45.2 and 58.5 respectively, which are inferior to using MoCoV2 for our framework.\n\n> Q7: Which dataset is evaluated in Table 1 of Supple. Is it CIFAR-100?\n> \n> A7: The dataset evaluated in Table 1 of supplementary is ImageNet-100, following the setting in [B]. We will clarify this in the final version.\n\n> Q8: Open questions: (1) In the open-set setting (Table 1 of Supple), did you use any technique to recognize the samples of known and unseen classes? If no, will the model assign all the samples to the known classes and give very few values/probabilities to the novel classes? (2) It would be nice that the authors can provide a visualization for the local comparison process.

For this particular setting, to overcome the issue of the model biasing towards the known classes, following [B], the classifier weight and features are l2-normalized during training, and we also use the same regulation term as in [B] to optimize the KL divergence between the predicted logits and a uniform distribution to prevent the known class to dominate the prediction. We will include detailed discussion about this setting and clarify these details in the final version. (2) Thanks for the suggestion. We will include the visualization for the local comparison process in the final version.\n\n[A] Learning deep features for discriminative localization, CVPR 2016\n\n[B] Open-World Semi-Supervised Learning, Arxiv 2021\n\n\n",

    "comment": "> Q1: I wonder why the authors do not conduct fine-tuning on labeled data before training with unseen unlabeled data. Does initialization with self-supervised learning generate more robust pseudo-labels than a fine-tuned model in the early training stage? and why? In a similar vein, what initialization is used for the Ours w/o Self-sup in Table 4?\n> \n> A1: Indeed, like [A, B, C], conducting the fine-tuning on labelled data before training with unlabelled data is helpful, however, we found that our method can already produce promising results without this step, while adding this extra fine-tuning stage will require more computation. Thus, we simplify the framework by not including it. We experiment on the CUB-200 dataset by adding this extra fine-tuning stage, and the resulting ACC is 48.2. The number w/o this additional stage is 47.8. We will include numbers on the other datasets with this additional fine-tuning stage in our final version. For the initialization of Ours w/o Self-sup experiments in Table 4, we simply use a random initialization.\n\n> Q2: Some experimental issues. (1) How did the authors conduct validation? Due to the existence of unseen classes in unlabeled data, how to conduct validation is not trivial. (2) Have different distillation approaches been investigated for mutual training? Such as the l2-regularization between zi and zi\u2032.\n> \n> A2: (1) We adopt the same validation process as in [A, B, C] for selecting hyperparameters using only the labelled data. Specifically, we further split the $C^l$ known classes into two subsets, an anchor probe set (keeping the labels) and a validation probe set (dropping the labels, and pretending to be unlabelled). The number of classes in the validation probe set is set to $C^u$. We train our model on these two sets to determine the hyperparameters by examining the performance on the validation probe set. These parameters are then used to train the model with $C^l$ labelled classes and $C^u$ unlabelled classes. (2)Thanks for the suggestion. We follow the suggestion to use l2-regularization between zi and i`, and the ACC on CUB-200 and Stanford-Cars are 44.2 and 57.9 respectively, which lag behind the numbers 47.8 and 61.9 using the symmetric KLD loss. We further explored the JSD loss as pointed out in Q3 below.\n\n> Q3: Equation of Jensen Shannon Divergence (Eq. 6) is wrong.\n> \n> A3: Thanks for pointing out our carelessness here. Eq. 6 is actually the symmetric KL Divergence (sKLD). We will correct this in the final version. Additionally, we also experiment with the proper JSD on CUB-200, and obtain a slightly better ACC of 48.2. Moreover, by further introducing the extra fine-tuning stage on labelled data as mentioned in Q1, we can achieve a further boost of ACC to 48.4 on CUB-200. We appreciate the constructive comment and will carry out the corresponding experiments on other datasets and include the results in our final version. \n\n\n[A] Learning to Discover Novel Visual Categories via Deep Transfer Clustering, ICCV 2019\n\n[B] Automatically Discovering and Learning New Visual Categories with Ranking Statistics, ICLR 2020\n\n[C] AutoNovel: Automatically Discovering and Learning Novel Visual Categories.

    "comment": "Thank you for your time spent reviewing our paper. We appreciate your comments and hopefully we can clear up your concerns.\n\nTheorem 1 is not a corollary of Theorem 1 from [15].  The key contribution of our Theorem 1 is part 1, which says that in nonconvex-PL/SC zero-sum games, any critical point that is not a strict local minmax is not stable for all $\\tau >0$. In other words, critical points that are not strict local minmax are never stable no matter the choice of timescale separation. We crucially exploit the quadratic growth condition of PL/SC functions in the proof to obtain part 1 of our theorem, whereas the result from Theorem 1 from [15] is about stability and not instability and is focused on the more general setting of nonconvex-nonconcave zero-sum games with weaker characterizations. Thus, our result is a novel and actually requires different proof methods. Moreover, our Theorem 1 is also key to the rest of our results that build off of it since it implies that the only critical points that could possibly be stable are strict local minmax. \n\nTheorem 1 from [15] says that there exists a $\\tau^{\\ast}\\in (0, \\infty)$ such that $z=(x, y)$ is stable for all $\\tau \\in [\\tau^{\\ast}, \\infty)$ if and only if $z$ is a strict local minmax. Part 2 of our Theorem 1 strengthens the result from Theorem 1 of [15] to say that in nonconvex-PL/SC zero-sum games, that after the minimum $\\tau^{\\ast}$ such that $z$ is stable, $z$ is stable for all $\\tau \\geq \\tau^{\\ast}$. In particular, it strengthens the result by establishing that a point $z$ cannot become stable, then go to being unstable, and then return to being stable when it is a strict local minmax equilibrium. The fact that such a $\\tau^{\\ast}$ exists such that for all $\\tau >\\tau^{\\ast}$, a strict local minmax is stable can be determined by Theorem 1, from [15]. Primarily, the point of stating Part 2 of Theorem 1 is to make clear that there is a finite timescale separation such that any strict local minmax can be stable, but the most novel and important contribution of our Theorem 1 is Part 1. \n\nWe believe this is made fairly clear in the paragraph after our Theorem 1, but let us know if you have any remaining questions or concerns in this regard.\n\nTheorem 1 does not include a choice of $\\tau^{\\ast}$ for several reasons. First, the value of $\\tau^{\\ast}$ is dependent on a particular equilibrium. That is, it is not necessarily uniform across all the strict local minmax equilibrium. Moreover, for a particular equilibrium $z=(x, y)$, the value of $\\tau^{\\ast}$ can be obtained via the construction in Theorem 1 of [15]. Notably, this construction depends on properties of the equilibrium. \n\nThis being said, the potential functions that are constructed imply a choice of $\\tau$ such that a strict local minmax equilibrium is ensured to be stable. Specifically, as stated in Lemma 1 and Theorem 2, for $\\tau>7\\kappa^2$, there is a potential function. As can be seen in the proofs of Lemma 1 and Theorem 2 in Appendix D.1 and D.2, the potential function only stops decreasing at critical points (that is $z=(x,y)$ such that $\\nabla_xf(x, y)=0$, $\\nabla_yf(x, y)=0$). Since we have shown in Lemma 2 that the discrete-time update converges to strict saddles on a set of measure zero and in Theorem 1 that points that are not strict local minmax are saddles for any choice of timescale $\\tau$, this together implies that with this choice of $\\tau$ that the update will almost surely converge to a strict local minmax. Thanks for pointing this out and we will make it more clear in the paper.\n\nWe would like to respectively push back against your claim that ``Although the PL and SC conditions bring the global asymptotic convergence of $\\tau$-GDA and$\\tau$-PGDA, the results of section 5 and 6 are familiar with nonconvex optimization researchers\u2019\u2019. There are no such results of global convergence to only strict local minmax equilibrium for nonconvex-PL/SC zero-sum games. Moreover, there has actually been no finite-time saddle escaping result for zero-sum games. We ask that you please carefully consider this since it seems to be discounting the results without any basis.\n\nWe believe that this work stands on its own without empirical results, given that it is already nearly 50 pages with a significant amount of theoretical analysis. Moreover, we study a common algorithm which is already used in practice, so it is not entirely clear how empirical results would strengthen the paper. We note that a significant proportion of related papers on nonconvex-PL/SC zero-sum games do not contain empirical studies and also that often when they do the actual experiments reflect settings where the theoretical assumptions are violated.\n\nThe practical examples were intended to be illustrative and it was mentioned following them (see lines 78-79) that the formulations can be converted to analogous unconstrained problems with appropriate modifications. We would be happy to make it more concrete how this would be done if you believe it would make the presentation of the paper stronger in your view. For instance, consider example 1. The problem formulation stated in the paper was\n     $$\\min_{W} \\max_{i=1,\\ldots, m} L_i(W)$$\nwhere we can treat $L_i(W)$ as the cross entropy loss for class $i\\in [m]$ and recall that $W$ is denoting the weights of the neural network. This problem can be similarly formulated as an unconstrained nonconvex-strongly-concave problem by using the formulation\n$$\\min_{W} \\max_{\\lambda \\in  R^m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i L_i(W) - \\nu ||\\lambda||_2^2$$\nwhere $\\nu>0$ is a regularization parameter. The inner maximization is strongly concave since it is a sum of a linear function and a strongly concave function. Thus, the overall problem is a nonconvex-strongly-concave zero-sum game. Note that since the losses are always positive, clearly this objective still encourages the maximizer to put most weight on the the class where the loss is highest. Moreover, strictly convex regularizers (such as $||\\lambda||_2^p$ for $p\\geq 2$ even) could be added to make the penalty sharper or smooth strongly-convex (concave) approximations of the $\\ell_1$ norm could be used as a regularizer to enforce the sparsity.\nThere are many other adjustments that can be made, but we gave this example to give the simplest formulation which would result in an analogous objective. Similar reformulations could be made for examples 2 and 3. We note that relaxations of this type from constrained problems to unconstrained problems are also common in normal function optimization.\n\n\nThanks for your consideration of our response!

    "review": "I will start by saying that the fact that local minimax points are stable for non-convex strong concave or PL landscapes is not suprising since effectively the hessian with respect to y is negative definite (invertible) and all degenerecies are avoided (we can decide about stability by checking the eigenvalues of the hessian and not cheking third order terms) and moreover use the multiplicative property of the determinant and Schur complement to derive a relation between the eigenvalues of the Hessian, the lower right block matrix of the Hessian and its schur complement.

Which parts of the proofs carry over for constrained min-max optimization?",
    "comment": "Thank you for your time spent reviewing and the helpful feedback you have provided. \n\nThere is a major point we would like to clear up first that is critical. In your review, you say that \u201cThe fact that we have convergence to local minimax is not surprising (similar result appears in https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08297), \u201d. These results you refer to only give convergence to what the authors refer to as `first-order nash equilibrium\u2019, which in the unconstrained setting is just a critical point (meaning $z=(x,y)$ such that $\\nabla_xf(x, y)=0$, $\\nabla_yf(x, y)=0$) which corresponds to any stationary point of the dynamics. That is, they are only showing convergence to critical points of the dynamics (also with a different algorithm) and they are saying nothing about whether the critical point is any type of equilibrium (specifically a local minmax point), which requires assessing the critical points in terms of second order conditions. So just to reiterate, their results give convergence guarantees to critical points (meaning they only satisfy first order conditions), which could even be local-maxmax points, whereas we are giving a much stronger convergence guarantee to only strict local minmax. This is actually our primary motivation for the work in this paper, so it is a crucial distinction and in fact the key significance of our results we hope is now clear. \n\nGiven our interpretation of your comment about the local minmax being stable not being surprising, it appears you are claiming that since $\\text{det}(J_{\\tau}(z)) = \\text{det}(S_1(J(z)))\\text{det}(-\\tau D_2^2 f(z))$, it is straightforward that $z=(x, y)$ is stable when $S_1(J(z))$ and $-D_2^2f(z)$ are both positive definite in nonconvex-PL/SC games. This is in fact not true, since stability cannot be determined by the sign of the determinant of the Jacobian. The reason is that $\\text{det}(J_\\tau(z))$ being positive does not mean all the eigenvalues have positive real parts, which is the requirement for stability of z with respect to the dynamics (note that stability normally is defined in terms of negative real parts of the local linearization, here this is equivalent to having positive real parts of the Jacobian $J_\\tau$. This is because the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, so there could be negative eigenvalues of $J_\\tau$ that multiply together so that the product of all eigenvalues is positive. It has also already been established that for a fixed choice of $\\tau$, there can exist strict local minmax equilibrium that are not stable (see e.g., [15, 21] ). For a simple example, consider $f(x, y)= -1.5*x^2 + 4xy- y^2$. The only critical point is $z=(0, 0)$. The Jacobian with $\\tau=1$ is $J_{1}(z)=[-3, 4; -4, 2]$ which has eigenvalues of $-0.5\\pm i\\sqrt{39}$ so it is not stable. But it is a strict local minmax since $-D_2^2f(z)=2>0$ and $S_1(J(z))=-3+(4^2)/2=5>0$. However, for all $\\tau>1.5$, $z$ is in fact stable.\n\nThank you for your appreciation of the result that all points that are not local minmax are not stable for any choice of $\\tau$. We agree this is interesting since it indicates that no matter the choice of timescale separation, the only points that can possibly be stable are strict local minmax equilibrium. This is not only because of the $x$ players variables, but it actually has to do with interaction structure between the players, and the cost structure with respect to only the $y$ players variables. Essentially the result is saying that given $-D_2^2f(z)$ is positive definite and $S_1(J(z))=D_1^2f(z)-D_{12}f(z)[D_2^2f(z)]^{-1}D_{12}^{\\top}f(z)$ is not positive definite, then $-J_{\\tau}(z)$ cannot be a Hurwitz matrix. You can see from the given information that the Schur complement not being positive definite can imply things about each matrix in the game Jacobian, so it is not solely dependent on the $x$ player variables. That being said, given that $-D_2^2f(z)$ is positive definite, when $S_1(J(z))$ is not positive definite, we at least know that $D_1^2f(z)$ is not positive definite. But again, it is important to recall that $D_1^2f(z)$ can be not positive definite, and $z$ can still be a strict local minmax since $S_1(J(z))$ may still be positive definite. In fact, the example above in the previous paragraph is exactly like this.\n\n\nWe also want to note that our result about PGDA uses techniques from the perturbed GD dynamics, there are actually some major distinctions so it is not necessarily an expected result. In particular, a key step is actually showing that the function itself can be a potential function for gradient descent-ascent, whereas this has not been a typical potential function in other analysis's of nonconvex-strongly-concave zero-sum games. Then there is some additional challenges that result from the nonsymmetric nature of the Jacobian of the dynamics, so this is a pretty significant departure from just applying the result for perturbed gradient descent. More discussion of this was provided in both Section 6 and the beginning of Appendix E in the paragraph titled `` Differences from the single player optimization setting\u2019\u2019 at line 1062.  Moreover, to obtain this result necessarily needs the stability and instability characterization of Theorem 1. Thus, we think that you may be discounting this result some and we would ask you to consider that.\n\nIn your review, you say that `overall, I think the paper is interesting but not super strong\u2019. We hope that the comments above make you feel differently. If they did not, could you explain some more to us why you feel this way? It was not clear from your review where this statement is coming about from.\n\nThere are certainly games where there is eigenvalues with imaginary parts in the Jacobian, in fact this is the norm and not an exception. As one simple convex-concave game, consider the zero sum game  $(f,-f)$ defined by $f(x, y)= -0.1*x^2 + 2xy- y^2$.  This is non-convex in $x$ and strongly-concave in $y$ (hence, PL). Then, with $\\tau=1$, $J_{\\tau}(0, 0)=[-0.2, 2; -2, 2]$ and the eigenvalues are $0.9\\pm- 1.67i$. We note this is not a degenerate example; it is straightforward to construct a parametric version of this game such that there is a continuum of games with imaginary eigenvalues.  We are not sure about the significance of this inquiry, but are happy to provide more examples if you could please elaborate further.\n\nIt is difficult to say in short order what parts of the proofs would carry over to the constrained setting, so we would rather keep the discussion focused on the unconstrained setting which is the setting we are studying in this paper. That being said, we believe the constrained setting is a really interesting direction of work that will certainty be pursued in the future by us or others and likely this work will be a key step toward developing those results.\n\nThanks for your consideration of our response!

    "comment": "Thank you for your time spent reviewing and the helpful feedback you have provided. \n\nRegarding your questions/comments in order:\n\n1a. The practical examples were intended to be illustrative and it was mentioned following them (see lines 78-79) that the formulations can be converted to analogous unconstrained problems with appropriate modifications. We would be happy to make it more concrete how this would be done if you believe it would make the presentation of the paper stronger in your view. For instance, consider example 1. The problem formulation stated in the paper was\n     $$\\min_{W} \\max_{i=1,\\ldots, m} L_i(W)$$\nwhere we can treat $L_i(W)$ as the cross entropy loss for class $i\\in [m]$ and recall that $W$ is denoting the weights of the neural network. This problem can be similarly formulated as an unconstrained nonconvex-strongly-concave problem by using the formulation\n$$\\min_{W} \\max_{\\lambda \\in  R^m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i L_i(W) - \\nu ||\\lambda||_2^2$$\nwhere $\\nu>0$ is a regularization parameter. The inner maximization is strongly concave since it is a sum of a linear function and a strongly concave function. Thus, the overall problem is a nonconvex-strongly-concave zero-sum game. Note that since the losses are always positive, clearly this objective still encourages the maximizer to put most weight on the the class where the loss is highest. Moreover, strictly convex regularizers (such as $||\\lambda||_2^p$ for $p\\geq 2$ even) could be added to make the penalty sharper or smooth strongly-convex (concave) approximations of the $\\ell_1$ norm could be used as a regularizer to enforce the sparsity.\nThere are many other adjustments that can be made, but we gave this example to give the simplest formulation which would result in an analogous objective. Similar reformulations could be made for examples 2 and 3. We note that relaxations of this type from constrained problems to unconstrained problems are also common in normal function optimization.\n\n1b. Yes, in equation (3) it should be f_i.\n\n2. This gradient does always exist in the nonconvex-PL/SC problems since Danskin\u2019s (or a Danskin-like) Theorem does hold (for the PL-case, see Lemma A.5 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08297.pdf and note that this would be evaluating the derivative at any maximizer among the set of maximizers). We are happy to edit the paper and make this more clear. Nonetheless, this was simply meant to compare to what others have considered as notions of stationarity and not all together important for our results.\n\n3a. We are not sure what you mean that we define the constrained min-max problem but study the unconstrained problem.  We would like to refer you back to the first paragraph of the paper (see line 19 where we define the sets X and Y to be Euclidean space) which defines the class of games we study to be on unconstrained spaces and also the beginning of Section 3. \n\n3b. f* was defined in line 379 primarily to point out that we assume that the minimum function value is bounded for the result. In addition on unconstrained spaces, having f be bounded ensures existence of local minmax equilibrium.\n\n\n4. We believe that this work stands on its own without empirical results, given that it is already nearly 50 pages with a significant amount of theoretical analysis. Moreover, we study a common algorithm which is already used in practice, so it is not entirely clear how empirical results would strengthen the paper. We note that a significant proportion of related papers on nonconvex-PL/SC zero-sum games do not contain empirical studies and also that often when they do the actual experiments reflect settings where the theoretical assumptions are violated.\n\nFinally, we would like to push back somewhat against your comment that the results are not very surprising. The results combine a number of nontrivial technical arguments and give convergence guarantees to game-theoretically meaningful equilibrium (specifically local minmax equilibria) in the most general class of games that has appeared in the literature to date. The fact that Danskin like results may hold in no way makes the results trivial (which we acknowledge you also agreed with), especially given that the inner problem is not actually being solved at each step (even approximately). Thus, we are showing that with the appropriate modifications (namely timescale separation), standard implementations of gradient descent ascent for these classes of problems have strong theoretical guarantees. Overall our belief is that despite the massive amount of work on these problem classes in the recent years, we fill a key missing gap by giving convergence to only game-theoretic equilibrium as opposed to first order notions of stationarity (which may in fact be local max-max points).  The significance of these results is akin to the results from nonconvex optimization that show almost sure asymptotic or finite-time convergence to local minimum, which themselves have been foundational to that field. \nMoreover, it is is not necessary for results to be surprising to be worthwhile or important.\n\nThanks for your consideration of our response! Please let us know if you have any remaining concerns or if there is anything that would help you be able to recommend this paper as an accept.",

In particular, our theoretical results show that any non-crossing network should give the same results with QR and Cram\u00e9r losses, since the gradients are collinear (in particular, we could informally write CNC-CR-DQN = CNC-QR0-DQN  and NC-CR-DQN = NC-QR0-DQN where QR0=QR loss without Huberization). \n\n*Detailed comments:*\n[31]\u00a0claimed that NC-QR-DQN converged faster than QR-DQN **in the exploration bonus setting**. In that paper, no results are provided for the standard $\\varepsilon$-greedy setting that we consider. Since the cost of the experiments is high, we couldn't afford running their network with the standard $\\varepsilon$-greedy strategy on the whole set of games. The examples of Figure 5, where NC-CR-DQN underperforms significantly, motivated us to propose a new non-crossing architecture to test our theoretical findings which, from our point of view, are the most important contribution of this paper. \n",

    "review": "**Strong points**: \n-\tThe connection between 1-Wasserstein and Cramer seems novel and interesting in DRL.  Especially, quantile regression in QR-DQN imposes order into the learnable particles $\\\\{ \\theta_i \\\\}_{i=1}^N$ as each $\\theta_i$ is an estimate of the $\\hat{\\tau}_i$-quantile which implies the monotonicity in the particles, i.e., $\\theta_1 \\leq \\theta_2 \\leq ... \\leq \\theta_N$. Cramer distance on the other hand is equivalent to 1-Wasserstein in terms of projection onto the space of a mixture of Heaviside step functions and in terms of gradients. Moreover, Cramer distance does not require order among $\\theta_i $\n\n**Weak points**: \n- Many parts of the writing are unclear and need more improvement (see below)\n- I think the present paper lacks a discussion and comparison with related work that is directly related to the problem and proposed solution. \n- The motivation and purpose of the experimental section are unclear and there is no conclusion or discussion drawn from the experiment. The experimental result does not show that the proposed algorithm CNC-CR-DQN outperforms QR-DQN with statistical significance in the whole range of Atari games (Fig 6). This raises the question of whether the proposed algorithm is effective and necessary. \n- The theoretical results are quite simple and the connection between Cramer and Wasserstein is already made in [2]. \n\n\n**Comments and Questions**:  \n-\tI think the paper lacks relevant literature. Most distributional RL methods are based on quantile regression that requires ordered statistics in neural representation, creating challenges such as maintaining ordered statistics, monotonicity, and \u201ccrossing quantiles\u201d. I think a recent work [Nguyen-Tang et al AAAI\u201921, \u201cDistributional Reinforcement Learning via Moment Matching\u201d] can completely avoid such problems in quantile-regression-based methods using moment matching; thus it is directly related to the problem and the proposed approach in the present paper. What is the difference between your approach and Nguyen-Tang's in addressing the order statistics constraint in QR-based DRL? \n-\tThe paper addresses the crossing quantile problem in DRL but it only briefly touches on crossing quantile in one sentence at line 47-48 and at line 155. I think it is inadequate. More discussion is needed and probably one dedicated paragraph for this is necessary.\n-\tLine 130-131: What exactly permutation in the symmetric group of size N? What **symmetric group** are you referring to? This part needs to be clearer. \n-\tEq. (14): What is $\\theta\u2019$? A typo? \n-\tThe experiment section lacks a clear explanation what is the purpose of the experiment? What conclusions can be drawn from the results? Currently, this section merely just describes the experimental procedure without insights drawn from it.\n-\tI think putting markers on Fig 6 would make it easier to read. Some colors are very similar. \n-\tFig 6:  CNC-CR-DQN outperforms QR-DQN in several games but in the entire Atari set, they perform very similarly (Fig. 6). How can you conclude that the proposed method that draws on Cramer distance without crossing quantiles works better in a statistical sense? \n- 1-Cramer distance ($ \\int |F(z) - G(z)| dz $) is identical to 1-Wasserstein distance and using 1-Crammer distance also does not require order among $\\theta_i$ as 2-Cramder distance. Why don't just use 1-Cramer distance? \n- What kind of games from the Atari set the proposed algorithm performs better than QR-DQN?\n\n**Initial Recommendation**\nWhile the idea of using Cramer distance as an alternative to the quantile regression loss is interesting, I do not find sufficient novelty and/or significant empirical performance in the current form, raising the question about the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm; moreover, the writing seems in rush and lacks related work. I vote for reject this time for the current form.  \n",

However, as shown in Fig 5 and discussed in line 177, without this order constraint the learning process can be more difficult. We left for future work to investigate how we can improve the learning process with the Cram\u00e9r loss without order constraints.

Yes, the QR and the Cram\u00e9r losses give collinear gradients so they are exchangeable for gradient descent algorithms, in the fixed quantile levels setting. We used the Cram\u00e9r loss to illustrate this fact since QR is the commonly used loss. In fact, it is no trouble to compute the Cram\u00e9r loss since our algorithm has $O(N \\log N)$ complexity while for the QR loss  algorithm it is $O(N^2)$. \n2. Thanks for the suggestion. As we said in the general response, the goal of this paper was to present the theoretical results. The experimental results aim at illustrating the theory. Since we found that NC-QR-DQN drastically fails in some cases, we proposed this new architecture to enforce the non-crossing constraints. We agree that more research is required to understand the effect of the different components of the architecture, but we leave this for another paper.\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for your comments and suggestions. \n\n* *\"1. I am concerned about the validity of the experiment results\"*: Regarding the implementation of QR-DQN: the results come from the precomputed results of Deepmind's DQN_ZOO implementation (https://github.com/deepmind/dqn_zoo/blob/master/results.tar.gz). If you look at  Figure 4 in [10] right plot (training performance), the median (over 3 seeds) is 127% (measured from the plot with https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) which is close to (and **below**) the 129% found with DQN_ZOO (with 5 seeds).\n\n* *\"2 .The advantages of Cramer loss over quantile (Huber) loss are not well presented..\"*: Yes, the complexity of our Cram\u00e9r **algorithm** is better than the QR loss one ($O(N \\log N)$ vs $O(N^2)$ ). An important message of our paper is that the standard QR loss is essentially equivalent to the Cram\u00e9r loss, under non-crossing constraints.\n\n* *\"3. Unfortunately, there is a nearly same network architecture called NDQFN\u2026 However, NDQFN seems to achieve much better performance than CNC with Cramer loss.\"*:   Thanks for pointing this recent work out, we will add a reference to it. However, we can't directly conclude from that paper that it achieves a better performance than CNC-CR-DQN,  since, for the whole set of 57 games, only evaluation metrics under the best agent protocol are presented while our results are expressed in terms of online training performance as advised by [20].\n\n* *\"4. The experimental results in the present form is not strong.\"*: please see general response\n",

    "review": "This paper is well motivated -- a number of saliency methods are affected by noisy gradients, often mitigating this effect with solutions that aren't well motivated (e.g., changing backprop rules). The paper is extensive, thoughtful, and thorough in its experimentation and analysis, covering a wide range of ML domains and showing convincingly that their paradigm works across different settings, for instance, by reducing the noise in saliency maps, widening the separation between uninformative and informative input features as highlighted by saliency methods, improving performance of saliency map methods when evaluated on the model accuracy drop benchmark. In particular, its analysis on feature replacement paradigms (section 5.1, under \"model accuracy drop\") a useful insight into how to consider methods like ROAR and OOD. Additionally, its experiment showing that its interpretable training paradigm mitigates the vanishing saliency of recurrent neural networks is an exciting result. Both the insights presented in this paper as well as the novel training paradigm introduced can be used and built upon in future works.\n\nThe rest of this review contains large and small suggestions for the authors to consider.\n\nLarge:\n* Could this paradigm be adapted and used as a fine-tuning procedure?

    "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful and detailed review.\n\n***Re: \u201cCould this paradigm be adapted and used as a fine-tuning procedure?\u201d*** Yes and this would be particularly useful for large datasets like imagenet. Below are some quantitative results showing the area under accuracy drop curve on MNIST (figure  3 in main paper) for gradient when training traditionally, training using interpretable procedure and fine-tuning (smaller AUC indicates better performance). \nWe find that fine-tuning improves the performance over traditionally trained networks. There is not much gain in training performance when training from scratch versus fine-tuning for small datasets like MNIST; however, for larger datasets like CIFAR10 we observed a clear decrease in the number of epochs when fine-tuning the network. The number of epochs for traditional training CIFAR10 is on average 118, interpretable training is 124 while fine-tuning takes only 70 epochs.\n\n|               | AUC     |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Traditional   | 3360.4  |\n| Interpretable | 1817.6  |\n| Fine-tuned    | 2258.75 |\n\n\n***Re: \u201cHow does this training paradigm impact performance\u201d*** There is minimal impact on the model accuracy.

We will add the mentioned papers along with others in the related work.\n\n\n***Re: \u201cLine 119: Expand a bit more on what additional computational cost\u201d*** The memory needed is doubled since now in addition to storing the batch we are storing the masked batch as well. Similar to adversarial training, this training process is slow and takes a larger number of epochs to converge. For example, CIFAR10 when traditionally trained takes on average 118 epochs to converge each epoch is roughly 24 seconds. While using interpretable training takes 124 epochs to converge each epoch taking 75 seconds (all experiments on the same GPU).\nWe will mention this explicitly in the updated paper.\n\n\n***Re: \u201cExplain more clearly why we should expect feature replacement methods to match IID replacement\u201d***  \nTo get accurate results during testing, one key assumption in machine learning is that the training and evaluation data come from the same distribution. When feature replacement comes from a different distribution, it is unclear whether the degradation in model performance comes from either the distribution shift or because the features that were removed were informative. For that reason, we need to make sure that the model is trained on the mask used during testing to avoid this adversarial effect.\n\n\n\n***Re: \u201cLine 114: Be more explicit that only input features are being masked\u201d*** We will clarify this in the main text and add details from the supplementary as advised.\n\n\n\n***Re: \u201cLine 132: Spell out which VGG network is used \u201d*** You are correct that we are using VGG16. We will explicitly mention this.\n\n\n\n***Re: \u201cLine 186: \\tilde{X} is already used\u201d*** Thank you for catching this. We will update this in the final draft.\n\n\n***Re: \u201cLine 186: Explain what R_i (predicted rationales) are in this context\u201d*** Predicted rationales are the words selected by the saliency method as informative. We will clarify this in the final draft.\n\n\n***Re: \u201cFigure 5 -- in caption, explain what the abbreviations for saliency methods mean  \u201d*** Grad, DL, GS, DLS stand for gradient, DeepLift, Gradient SHAP and DeepLift with Shapely values, respectively. We will explicitly mention them in figure 5.\n\n",

    "review": "Originality: Based on an intuitive idea that if gradient-based explanation methods faithfully interpret the model's predictions, irrelevant features should have gradient values close to zero, the authors provide a method (interpretable training) to improve interpretability. The proposed method combines the masking approach (line 103) and the KL divergence regularization (line 97) to solve the optimization problem in different tasks. The authors formulated this interpretable training with a concise equation of loss function (i.e., the prediction loss and the KL loss, line 107). The algorithm for interpretable training (Algorithm 1) is simple but novel for computing the masked input in each minibatch. Nevertheless, the reviewer thinks it is an effective approach to improve explainability.  \n\nPresentation Quality: The authors give extensive empirical analysis, especially for CV tasks (i.e., qualitative analysis in Figures 2A and 2B, quantitative analysis in Figure 2C and Figure 3), to demonstrate the better performance for interpretable training compared with other regular training methods. However, the following substantial issues should be addressed: (1) In Table 1, the performance for interpretable training for NLP tasks does not demonstrate consistent performance; the reason why a lower sufficiency for both FEVER and e-SNLI is not explained.  (2) In Table 1, for NLP tasks, only the vanilla gradient-based method is used; how about the more popular ones like DeepLift or IG? (3) In lines 114-116, the authors give how to implement masking functions in image, language, but how about for the time series?  Why can't these operations replace the low salient word with the previous high salient word (line 115) guarantee the argument of assigning low gradient values to irrelevant features in model predictions (in line 112), any theoretical explanation?  (4) Since the parameter k is very important for masking operation, in lines 116 -117, the authors point out how to select k for images (MNIST dataset); however, the selection of k for language and time series is not clear. (5) Other minor problems, e.g., the sequence number should be added for other formulas other than the KL-divergence (Eq (1)),  line number for Algorithm 1. \n\n-----New comments after reading authors' response\n\nI appreciate the response given by the authors, and most of my concerns have been successfully addressed by the responses. I think this work is  novel compared to other existing works on \"interpretable training\" in that this method can be used in more broad areas, NLP, CV, and time series prediction tasks, which is achieved via masking gradients without using attention maps. As such, I raise my rating to 6 to reflect my new assessment of the updated manuscript.\n\n\n",
    "comment": "Thank you for your detailed review.\n\n\n***Re: \u201c(1) In Table 1, the performance for interpretable training for NLP tasks does not demonstrate consistent performance\u201d*** It was surprising to find that generally, the sufficiency of different saliency methods is similar (or even in some cases worse) than random assignment, this is the case regardless of the training method. One possible explanation is due to the adversarial effect of shrinking the sentence to a much smaller size since the number of words identified as \u201crationales\u201d is smaller than the remaining words. However, we decided to report both metrics as done in the original paper.\n\n***Re: \u201c (2) In Table 1, for NLP tasks only the vanilla gradient-based method is used, how about the more popular ones*** As per your request, we added integrated gradients and SmoothGrad; results are shown below. \nOverall, the use of interpretable training improves the comprehensiveness for different saliency methods.\nWe did not include DeepLift in the table below due to time constraints as it is non trivial to incorporate DeepLift in the Eraser benchmark.\nWe will add these methods along with others in the final draft.\n\n|                                     | Comprehensiveness | Sufficiency |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Movies                              |                   |             |\n| Glove+LSTM + IG                     | 0.265             | 0.054       |\n| Glove+LSTM Interpretable + IG       | **0.306**             | **0.002**       |\n| Glove+LSTM + SmoothGrad               |   0.198                 |   0.034          |\n| Glove+LSTM Interpretable + SmoothGrad |   **0.256**                |  **0.008**           |\n| Fever                               |                   |             |\n| Glove+LSTM + IG                     |     0.008             |    0.005         |\n| Glove+LSTM Interpretable + IG       |  **0.009**            |  **0.004**           |\n| Glove+LSTM + SmoothGrad               |     0.007              |    0.006         |\n| Glove+LSTM Interpretable + SmoothGrad |    **0.008**               |   0.006          |\n| e-SNLI                              |                   |             |\n| Glove+LSTM + IG                     |   0.099                |   0.461          |\n| Glove+LSTM Interpretable + IG       |  **0.104**                  |  **0.419**            |\n| Glove+LSTM + SmoothGrad               |     0.117              |   0.476          |\n| Glove+LSTM Interpretable + SmoothGrad |  **0.118**                |    **0.455**        \n\n***Re: \u201c(3) In lines 114-116 the authors give how to implement masking functions\u201d*** For time series, similar to images, masking is done by replacing each feature with a random variable within the feature range. For NLP, we replaced low salient features with previous high salient ones because we want to emphasize the salient features and remove the non-salient ones while maintaining the sentence length. We will add these details to the updated draft.\n\n***Re: \u201c(4) Since the parameter k is very important for masking operation*** K is generally dataset-dependent. K was optimized on a validation dataset. The value of K depends on the amount of irrelevant information in a training sample. For example, in the NLP dataset Movies review the average number of tokens per review is 774.  Below is an example from the movie review dataset.\n\n> Kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in Birthday Girl , a film by the stage-trained Jez Butterworth -LRB- Mojo -RRB- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post-Full Monty world .\n\n\nWhile in the e-SNLI dataset the average number of tokens is 16. A data sample is shown below: \n\n> Premise: An adult dressed in black holds a stick. \nHypothesis: An adult is walking away, empty-handed.\n\n\nMovie reviews tend to have more filler words, so K for movie reviews (on average 465) is larger than that of e-SNLI ( on average 11).\n\n***Re: \u201c (5) Other minor problems\u201d*** Thank you for pointing this out. We will adjust this in the final draft.\n\n",

    "review": "*** Originality *** There are many prior works in \"interpretable training\", and it seems uneasy to name the method after this general field, especially given the prior works. Some works which incorporate interpretability into the training process in a self-supervised fashion include:\n\n- Tell Me Where to Look: Guided Attention Inference Network by Kunpeng Li et. al.\n- Sharpen Focus: Learning with Attention Separability and Consistency by Lezi Wang et. al.\n- Self-Erasing Network for Integral Object Attention by Qibin Hou et. al. - from NeurIPS 2018\n- Object Region Mining with Adversarial Erasing: A Simple Classification to\nSemantic Segmentation Approach by Yunchao Wei et. al.\n\nAlthough \"interpretable training\" has been around for a while, the authors do not include another interpretable training baseline. And although the papers I have mentioned evaluate on vision tasks, many of the ideas are extendable to the settings which the authors consider here, in the same manner (e.g., running the saliency methods on text instead of images).\n\n*** Quality *** \n\nI did not understand the ability of the box plots to show interpretability. As described in Figure 2: \"most features have gradient values around zero with large gaps between mean and outliers, indicating the model\u2019s ability to differentiate between informative and non-informative features.\" - Why is this true?\n\nAlso, I am wary of these results, since they seem to go against Goodhart's Law: \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to become a good measure.\" The input gradients were used directly in the model optimization process. If a saliency method is used for evaluating the interpretability, it should be a different one than what was used in optimization - for example, something black-box like RISE (by Vitali Petsiuk et. al.). Furthermore, there is prior work which shows that input gradients are often not interpretable (e.g., Bridging Adversarial Robustness and Gradient Interpretability by Beomsu Kim et. al.).\n\nIt is admirable that the authors evaluate their algorithm on many benchmarks, in a variety of forms of data - MNIST, CIFAR, and BIRD for images, Movies, FEVER, and e-SNLI for language, and synthetic time series benchmarks. They also use a variety of model architectures.\n\n*** Clarity *** The paper contains many grammar errors, although they are generally not a hindrance to understanding. For example, Line 119: \"Although we use on vanilla gradients during training to mask unimportant features which is not computationally expensive, this training procedure (similar to other training procedures like adversarial training as an example) is more expensive than traditional training.\"\n\nOn Line 138, the statement: \"We would expect the background gradient (i.e., most of the features) to be close to zero.\" This is not always true (e.g., the background can easily be correlated with the object, and thus feature importance on the background is likely to be non-zero). But, the model focusing on object features rather than background features can instead be stated as a desirable quality to have, rather than the expectation.\n\nTypo Line 172 - MINST\n\n*** Significance *** It is great that the method the authors propose is self-supervised, and does not rely on the need for ground truth saliency maps, which are often not available (at least, from true GT annotations. It could be possible to get pseudo-GT saliency guidance from a pretrained model which is, say, good at recognizing \"objectness\"). The loss function is also nice in its simplicity. However, as stated above, there are many prior works in interpretable training, which this paper has not compared to.",
    "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful review.\n\n\n***Re: \u201c There are many prior works in \"interpretable training\", and it seems uneasy to name the method after this general field, especially given the prior works\u201d*** Thank you for the suggestion. We will consider changing the name of the method to self-supervised interpretable training to be more specific.\n\n\n***Re: \u201cAlthough \"interpretable training\" has been around for a while, the authors do not include another interpretable training baseline.\u201d*** We would like to emphasize that our work is focused on increasing the model interpretability through training (similar to [5,6]) in a self-supervised manner.  We will add papers [1-4] in the related work sections. However, note that work [1,3,4] is from weakly supervised localization literature that uses attention maps to improve segmentation. Sharpen Focus [2] incorporates attention maps into training to improve classification accuracy. Taking Sharpen Focus [2] as an example, we repeated MNIST experiments described in section 5.1 (we choose MNIST rather than other datasets since we can show qualitative results through model accuracy drop; this is explained in the model accuracy drop subsection in lines 149-181). For this experiment, we remove features with high saliency which are identified by the gradient. Features are then replaced by a black background. The accuracy is calculated when removing different percentages of features. Below is the accuracy drop for different models along with the area under the curve (AUC). Note that a larger drop and smaller AUC are better. Not surprisingly, Sharpen focus is even less interpretable than a regular CNN. The reason this is the case is that it has a more complex architecture and is trained to improve accuracy not interpretability. Note that the one common benchmark in papers [1-4] is the PASCAL VOC 2012 image segmentation benchmark, while our paper is focused on interpretability.\n\n|               | 0     | 10   | 20   | 30   | 40   | 50   | 60   | 70   | 80   | 90   | AUC    |\n|---------------|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|--------|\n| Traditional   | 99.4  | 84.3 | 60.4 | 40.1 | 28.2 | 20.8 | 17.1 | 14.9 | 13.9 | 13.9 | 3360.4 |\n| Interpretable | 99.3  | 49.1 | 20.9 | 11.1 | 8.6  | 8.3  | 8.4  | 9.5  | 10.6 | 11.5 | 1817.6 |\n| Sharpen Focus | 100.0 | 73.4 | 50.0 | 43.7 | 32.8 | 28.1 | 26.6 | 23.4 | 20.3 | 15.6 | 3562.5 |\n\n\n***Re: \u201cI did not understand the ability of the box plots to show interpretability.\u201d*** The idea is that very small gradients indicate uninformative features while large gradients indicate informative ones [7] (Note by gradients we are referring to input gradients). The proposed training method helps reduce noisy fluctuating gradients in between which is shown in the box plot; we will clarify this in the final paper version.  \n\n\n***Re:\u201dAlso, I am wary of these results, since they seem to go against Goodhart's Law:\u201d*** We note that along with input gradients, we have used multiple other saliency methods in our evaluations including Integrated Gradients, DeepLIFT, SmoothGrad, Gradient SHAP and DeepLift with Shapely values, where the masking is done by vanilla gradient and the testing is done by the mentioned methods. Results are shown in figures 3 and 5 in the main paper along with figures 4-7 and tables 5-8 in the supplementary. Our method improves model interpretability even when using other evaluation metrics than the vanilla gradients.  \n\n***Re:\u201dClarity\u201d*** Thank you for pointing this out. We will make sure to fix all typos and grammatical errors.   \n\n***Re: \u201cOn Line 138, the statement: \"We would expect the background gradient to be close to zero.\" This is not always true\u201d*** we will clarify that we \u2018desire\u2019 the model to focus on object features rather than background features.\n\n\n\n[1] Tell Me Where to Look: Guided Attention Inference Network by Kunpeng Li et. al.  \n[2] Sharpen Focus: Learning with Attention Separability and Consistency by Lezi Wang et. al.  \n[3] Self-Erasing Network for Integral Object Attention by Qibin Hou et. al. - from NeurIPS 2018  \n[4] Object Region Mining with Adversarial Erasing: A Simple Classification to Semantic Segmentation Approach by Yunchao Wei et. al.  \n[5] Reza Ghaeini, Xiaoli Z Fern, Hamed Shahbazi, and Prasad Tadepalli.

    "comment": "Thank you for your detailed review.\n\n***Re: \u201cmost features..\u201d***  The gradient of the class score function with respect to the input can be interpreted as a (local) sensitivity map that identifies features that strongly influence the final decision [1]. The derivative of the class function with respect to the input may fluctuate sharply at small scales. This has been addressed in different ways: SmoothGrad[2]  addresses this by adding noise to the input multiple times, calculates the gradient, and takes the average. Our approach addresses this problem by enforcing spares regularization during training.\n\n\n***Re: \"If gradient-based\"*** You are correct that in recurrent neural networks there is a vanishing gradient problem for long sequences due to the network forgetting over time. This has been addressed in some architectures like Input-cell-attention [3]. Here we are addressing a different problem where our models don\u2019t suffer from vanishing gradients but there are small fluctuating gradients in inputs. We have benchmarked Input-cell-attention [3] for the synthetic time series dataset and showed that using our proposed training approach we were able to produce improved explanations results (please see Supplementary Table 6.) \n\n***Re: \"It would be useful\u201d*** Thank you for pointing us to the relevant paper. We have demonstrated this somehow empirically in the time series section where synthetic datasets have known informative and non-informative features where through experiments we show that the use of interpretable training improves the precision and recall of the produced explanations (results are in sup. Tables 5-8.) In our updated draft, we will highlight more examples showing the relation between small gradients and irrelevant features.\n\n***Re: \u201cS(X) would sort elements of X based on the sum of feature embeddings of each word x \u201d:*** What is the interpretation of the sum of the feature embeddings of each word?\u201d Thank you for pointing this out. Please note that we do not take the sum of the word embedding itself; we take the sum of the saliency of the word embedding as done in standard NLP practice [4]. Since the importance of a word can be represented by the importance of each dimension in the feature embedding.  Sorry for this misunderstanding, we will clarify this in the final draft.\n\n***Re:\u201cthe maps\u201d***  by noisy we are referring to visual noise (similar terminology has been used by [4]).

    "review": "Overall the paper is very well done. There are a few issues in the experiments I\u2019d like to see resolved and then I believe this work will be an excellent contribution to the community.\n\nIntroduction and Background\n1. Structure causing accuracy degradation in sparsification is not a hypothesis. It\u2019s well documented empirically [1, 2].\n2. \u201cHowever [unstructured sparsity\u2019s] hardware cost makes it infeasible to use on modern architectures\u201c. Recent work has shown that unstructured sparsity can be accelerated, although it still requires high sparsity to exceed the performance of dense computation [1, 3].\n\nExperiments (Changes Required)\n1. Table 3, claiming a \u20182x\u201d speedup over ASP is not correct. 2x more of the FLOPs in the model can now be accelerated by sparse tensor cores, which provide up to 2x performance over dense tensor cores. Let's say dense models speed is (fwd + bwd + update) / dense_throughput. For simplicity, we\u2019ll say fwd = bwd = update so baseline takes 3 * fwd / dense_throughput seconds. The ASP model would then take fwd / (2 * dense_throughput + 2 * fwd / dense_throughput = 2.5 * fwd / dense_throughput. Your model would then take 2 * fwd / (2 * dense_throughput) + fwd / dense_throughput = 2 * fwd / dense_throughput. Thus, ASP provides a 3 / 2.5 = 1.2x speedup over the baseline and you would provide a 2.5 / 2 = 1.25x speedup over ASP. In reality your speedup will be lower because not all operations (e.g., batch normalization, activation functions) are accelerated by sparse tensor cores and the sparse tensor core operations will not fully realize the theoretical 2x gain over the dense tensor cores. This should be corrected in the authors\u2019 response.\n2. I understand that 4:8 transposable masks have a similar MD to 2:4 masks but comparing 4:8 sparsity to 2:4 sparsity is not apples-to-apples as I expect 4:8 sparsity will make it much easier to maintain model quality. I like the inclusion of 4:8 sparsity results, but I\u2019d also like to see 2:4 transposable results to see what the accuracy loss looks like in comparison to non-transposable masks.\n3. In Table 2, what N:M are used? As I understand it, the algorithm complexity depends on these factors.\n4. X-axis in Figure 5 (b) should be scaled by 100 to be percent.\n\nExperiments (Changes Suggested)\n1. The hypothesis that MD is correlated with accuracy would be made much stronger with results on other kinds of structured sparsity. For example, block sparsity and channel-sparsity. As someone who works on this topic, I\u2019d be very interested to see these results.\n2. In Table 1, it might be nice to include the MD normalized to unstructured as well. This would make it easier to compare across the different structures for the reader.\n3. Most sparse training algorithms only perform mask updates periodically to reduce overhead (and also because it usually leads to higher accuracy). The update period is usually ~100 (e.g., with RigL). 40 is a tighter bound, but you could also run 100 (in Table 2) to align with prior work.\n\nOrganizational, Spelling and Grammar\n1. On page 2, your 3 questions are in a different order than they\u2019re shown in your diagram (Figure 4)\n2. \u201csparse core tensor\u201d should be \u201csparse tensor core\u201d\n3. \u201c|\u201d before \u201cIn\u201d should be deleted.\n\nAdditional Improvements\n1. Nvidia has recently proposed using permutations to reduce accuracy loss (talk, poster from SNN). How do permutations affect your MD metric? Do the results still correlate with accuracy? Do they make finding transposable N:M masks more difficult? These might be interesting questions to discuss in your conclusion.\n\nReferences\n1. https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09723\n2. https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00206\n3. https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10901\n",
    "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for his detailed review and positive feedback. Please see our answers below.\n\n\n$\\underline{\\textbf{Introduction \\hspace{2pt} and \\hspace{2pt}  Background}}:$\n\n$\\textbf{A1}$ Thank you for these references which support our work. We'll fix the final version according to your comments and add these references.\n\n$\\underline{\\textbf{Experiments \\hspace{2pt} (Changes \\hspace{2pt} Required)}}:$\n\n$\\textbf{A2}$  We agree with the reviewer that the '2x' speedup statement isn't correct and that the maximum speedup is 1.25x. As written in Tables 3 and 4 the correct term is '2x' sparse tensor core utilization (Fwd + Bwd in our method in comparison to only Fwd in ASP). We'll fix it in the revised manuscript.\n\n$\\textbf{A3}$ In section A.7 of the appendix (figure A.2) we plotted the accuracy for R50 with 2:4 transposable mask for the ASP setting. Following your comment, we perform a more thorough analysis of 2:4 transposable mask and discuss it in detail in the general comment above (\"2:4 works almost as well as 4:8\"). We intend to add those results to the revised manuscript.\n\n$\\textbf{A4}$ In Table 2 we used 4:8 transposed mask, which was the main focus of our work. As mentioned by the reviewer, the algorithm should depend on N:M, however as written in lines 223-224 they were implemented in a non-optimized way. Generally, as the block size increase the overhead increase and thus we expect a reduced overhead for the 2:4 experiments.\n\n$\\textbf{A5}$ Thank you for the thorough review, we'll fix the graph axis in the revised manuscript.\n\n$\\underline{\\textbf{Experiments \\hspace{2pt} (Changes \\hspace{2pt} Suggested)}}:$\n\n$\\textbf{A6}$ We showed in Table 1 the MD and his correlation to accuracy for \"sequential N:M sparsity\", i.e any block of size M must contain N sequential zeros - which is a type of block-sparsity pattern. With respect to channel pruning, we agree with the reviewer that it will be interesting to see there the correlation of MD with accuracy - we plan to add such experiments in the next version of the manuscript.\n\n$\\textbf{A7}$ We agree with the reviewer that it will be more clear for the reader to normalize the results in Table 1. We'll fix it in the next version.\n\n$\\textbf{A8}$ We experimented ResNet18 with 4:8 transposable mask, increasing the period between updates to 100 iterations and get a similar result (70.4\\%).\n\n$\\underline{\\textbf{Organizational, Spelling \\hspace{2pt} and   \\hspace{2pt} Grammar}}:$\n\n$\\textbf{A9}$ thank you for the thorough review, we'll fix all the grammar errors mentioned by the reviewer in the next version.\n\n$\\underline{\\textbf{Additional \\hspace{2pt} Improvements}}:$\n\n$\\textbf{A10}$ We believe the reviewer refers to the work \"Channel permutations for N:M sparsity\" presented in SNN workshop 2021. This work suggests a pre-processing method for permuting the channels in order to increase the magnitude of the masked weight for the corresponding N:M mask. Since this method is a pre-processing method for the weights, it shouldn't affect the MD which refers to the number of combinations after any pre-processing method. Therefore we argue that under channel permutation (CP), MD should have a similar correlation with model accuracy. Yet we expect channel permutation to increase the sparse model accuracy for all sparsity patterns. Since CP requires extracting the mask for each considerable permutation applying CP to any mask-finding algorithm would increase the running time. While this work was presented after we submitted our work, it would be interesting to find out if it can shorten the number of iterations required to regain accuracy. We'll add such discussion in the conclusions of the final version.\n\n\n\n",

    "review": "Strengths:\n\n-- The transposable mask is an interesting idea to enable the system capability of N:M sparse training. \n-- The proposed 2-approximation solution adds a low overhead in finding transposable masks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n-- The proposed transposable N:M masks add strong constraints to weight diversity, which may limit the expressiveness of the model. \n-- No real training speedups from the proposed method, because real hardware constraints are not satisfied. \n-- Lack of details of implementation and hyperparameter settings. \n-- Baseline results are inconsistent. \n-- No discussions on how model convergence or training dynamics are affected by N:M sparse training.\n\nComments:\n\n1. The transposable N:M sparsity masks seem to add very strong constraints to the weight matrices, which might limit the model's expressiveness in a significant way. Indeed, after applying transposable N:M sparsity masks, there won't be enough mask diversity for 2:4 sparsity. As a result, the paper has to find the transposable N:M sparsity in 4:8. This is a deviation from real hardware constraints because no existing hardware supports 4:8 sparsity (Nvidia sparse tensor core supports 2:4).  The proposed method, therefore, cannot speed up training on real hardware either. It is disappointing as the paper motivates itself as a way to accelerate sparse training on real hardware in the introduction and only to find out later that the solution does not really work on real hardware. \n\n2. Some of the results of the evaluations are inconsistent, especially the baseline results. While the baseline results for ResNet18 and ResNet50 are 69.7% and 76.1% in Table 3, they become 70.5% and 77.3% in Table 4. Why are there two results for the same dataset and task? Which baseline should we look at? If we take 77.3% as the baseline result for ResNet50, then the proposed N:M sparse training actually leads to a non-trivial drop (77.3 vs. 76.6) in Table 3, and the \"no accuracy degradation\" claim is also not true. Please double-check the results and also provide detailed hyperparameter information. \n\n3. Despite claiming 2x speedup, no real training time is reported for all evaluations. The training cost depends on both the training time per iteration as well as the total number of iterations needed to converge. Although N:M sparse training might reduce the training time per iteration by 2x,  if the N:M sparse training takes more iterations to converge to get the same accuracy or introduces training instability, then N:M sparse training cannot really reduce the training cost and reducing the cost of finding transposable N:M sparsity becomes even less motivated.  Furthermore, the 2x speedup claim also seems to be problematic because (1) finding the transposable N:M masks still add non-negligible cost, which would make the speedup to be less than 2X, and (2) even with sparse tensor core, one cannot expect a 2x speedup because a DNN contains more components than just the matrix multiplication, such as non-linear functions or BatchNorm, which cannot be accelerated by sparse tensor core. \n\n\n4. The paper lacks details for implementation and hyperparameter settings. Can the authors add details for how the model has been trained, such as the number of update steps, the batch size, etc. for both the baseline and the N:M sparse training, as well as parameters for AdaPrune? The current paper doesn't seem like it could be reproduced. \n\n5. The proposed AdaPrune only seems to convert models trained with 8:4 to 4:2 for inference. Can it also be used to accelerate the training speed as well? \n\n6. The writing of Section 5 seems to be not good, with many typos and grammar errors.

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for his comments, please see our answers below:\n\n$\\textbf{A1}$ The N:M transposable mask and the methods to generate them are defined in a generic fashion. The different structural mask constraints are then discussed in Section 5 (e.g., Figure 6). There, we show that transposable masks can be applied in various sparsity patterns with only minor degradations, including the 2:4 sparsity pattern. For example, see Figure A.2 for the 2:4 transposable mask in the ASP setting (i.e., \"initialized from a trained dense model\"). We discuss more thoroughly our 2:4 mask results in the general comment above (\" 2:4 works almost as well as 4:8\").\n\n$\\textbf{A2} \\hspace{2pt}$  In section 4.1 we discuss two independent types of experiments for the N:M transposable mask. In each case, we compare with relevant results from previous work and their own baseline. Specifically, for the \"initialized from a trained dense model\" experiments we use the torchvision model-zoo as the baseline (as it has a large set of pretrained models) and compare with ASP [34].  For a fair comparison, in the \"training from scratch\" experiments we use the N:M-SS [40]  settings and run the baseline models. We further discuss implementation details in appendix A.4. \n\n$\\textbf{A3}$ As stated in section A.4 of the appendix, in all the reported experiments we used the \\textit{\"original regime\"} (line 573) and \\textit{\"exact same setting\"} (line 577). That means also the same number of iterations. Additionally, for the \"training from scratch\" experiment we showed (Table 2) that the overhead for finding the N:M transposable mask using our \\textbf{non-optimized} implementation is only 14\\% for a single iteration. Since we change the mask once in 40 iterations (line 224) the overhead is insignificant. In the \"initialized from a trained dense model\" setting the overhead is even more negligible since we find the mask only once before training begins.\n\nRegardless, we agree with the reviewer that the acceleration refers only to the matrix multiplication operations (done by the tensor cores in NVIDIA's GPUs) and not to the scalar operations (done by Cuda cores in NVIDIA's GPUs). We will clarify it in the final manuscript. However, we note that matrix multiplication tends to be the bottleneck in modern accelerators. As evidence, NVIDIA increased the tensor-core to Cuda-cores throughput ratio in its latest architecture (Amper). V100 has 125 TFLOPS tensor cores and 15.7 TFLOPS of Cuda cores. A100 has 312 TFLOPS of tensor cores and 19.5 TFLOPS of Cuda cores. This emphasizes the importance of this work - accelerating the matrix multiplication engine.\n\n$\\textbf{A4}$ Perhaps the reviewer missed the last line in our abstract, where we give the full reference implementation, with scripts to reproduce the results in the paper. Additionally, in appendix A.4 we state the setting for all our experiments, \"\\textit{for the \"N:M initialized from a trained dense model\" experiments we use torchvision model-zoo as the baseline and trained with SGD over 90 epochs, batch size 256, with starting l.r of 0.1 and decreasing at epochs 30,60,80 by a factor of 10. For the \"Sparse training from scratch\" experiments we use the same hyperparameters as Zhou et al [40]. i.e SGD optimizer, batch size 256, l.r 0.1 with cosine annealing scheduler. For the AdaPrune experiments, we use 1000 images as the calibration set, run them for 1000 iterations with batch size 100.}\n\n$\\textbf{A5}$ AdaPrune is a very light method for converting between models sparsity patterns for inference (e.g., 2:4 to 1:2 see Appendix A.1). Generally AdaPrune cannot be used to accelerate training, yet we show in appendix A.1 it can be used for convert a dense pre-trained model to an N:M sparse model.\n\n$\\textbf{A6}$ Thank you for pointing out these grammars errors. We'll fix them in the revised manuscript.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[34] Nvidia. a100 tensor core gpu architecture. 2020.

    "review": "## Strengths\n\n* The paper  broadens our understanding of the Dasgupta objective, and for this reason I consider it an important contribution to the area of hierarchical clustering. For example, the algorithm presented in the paper for the 'expander' case only uses the node degrees. \n* I find the theoretical contribution highly nontrivial. On one hand, the fact that good expansion implies that the problem is tractable is not surprising (at least to me). However, turning this into an algorithm that also works in the case of clusterable graphs takes some highly nontrivial technical work.\n* The paper is well-written and generally clear.\n\n## Weaknesses\n* The empirical evaluation says the algorithm improves upon \"state-of-the-art\", but I think this may be misleading, as the algorithm from the paper is typically outperformed by average-linkage clustering. I think the paper should comment on this and try to analyze the phenomenon, instead of ignoring the issue entirely.\n* The result is unsurprising, in the sense that it's expected that by assuming stronger conditions on the input, one can obtain a better approximation guarantees. Still, making this idea work looks like solid piece of work.\n\n## Specific comments\n\n* Line 27: Is some word missing between 'is' and 'with'?\n* Line 68: O(1 + o(1)) can be simplified to O(1). Do you mean O(1) or 1+o(1)?\n* line 153: I think that condition (2) is redundant, as it is implied by condition (3)\n* Lemma 4.1: Is \\ell a parameter or something that the algorithm computes?\n\n## Questions for authors\n* Please analyze the empirical results taking average linkage into account, and be open about what it shows and what it does not. The analyzed algorithm is theoretical in nature, and I highly doubt one can show this can be a competitive method in practice. One approach would be to focus on comparison to the previous theoretical algorithm, include hierarchical stochastic block model in the studied datasets, and comment that average/single linkage are only added for reference. Right now, the writing in the empirical section is highly misleading to me, i.e., suggests the proposed method *is* competitive in practice, which, in my understanding, is contradicted by the pictures.",
    "comment": "Many thanks for your time and very positive review of our work. We have addressed each of your specific points below. Please let us know if you have any further questions and we will be happy to discuss them. \n \n==== On the use of \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d (Point 1 of Weakness) === \n \nIn the submission the previous state-of-the-art refers to Cohen-Addad et al. [11] since, prior to our work, [11] is the only algorithm specifically designed for graphs consisting of multiple clusters with theoretically proven approximation guarantee. We didn\u2019t view the average-linkage (AL) as the state-of-the-art, because there is no theoretical approximation guarantee of AL with respect to Dasgupta\u2019s cost function, even in the case of well-clustered graphs. It wasn\u2019t our intention to ignore the issue entirely, and we will reformulate our discussion in the final version to make our point clearer. \n \n=== On the specific comments === \n \nLine 27: There is no missing word between \u201cis\u201d and \u201cwith\u201d, the meaning of the sentence being that the approximation guarantee depends on the conductance of $G$. We will rewrite this sentence if it would improve the readability in your point of view. \n \nLine 68:  This is indeed a typo, and it should be $(1+o(1))$.  \n \nLine 153: You are right that the node $A_k$ referred in condition (3) is unique, thus making the dense branch well defined even if condition (2) is removed. However, we feel that the current form of introducing the dense branch improves the understanding for the reader unfamiliar with this concept.  We will consider to drop condition (2) if you think that would make the overall presentation cleaner. \n \nLemma 4.1: $\\ell$ is the number of clusters returned by the partitioning algorithm, hence the parameter that the algorithm computes. It is not a parameter that out algorithm sets. \n \n\n=== On the questions for authors === \n  \nIn the final version, we will make it clearer that the average/single linkage are only added for reference, and the main contribution of our work is mainly the theoretical one, rather than presenting some competitive algorithm in practice. We will also include hierarchical stochastic block model in the studied databases.",

    "review": "Overall I think this is a solid theory paper. Roughly speaking, the technical part of the paper is structured as follows:\n- It starts with a discussion on graphs with high conductance. Such a graph can be though of as one single cluster for which there might not be a reasonable cut. With a motivating example (Figure 1), the authors proposed to group vertices of similar degrees first to reduce the hierarchical clustering cost.\n- On such a graph, the authors designs Algorithm 1 which constructs the hierarchical clustering tree based on degrees, and proves it is a constant approximation by moving vertices around in the HC tree and slightly modifying the HC tree step by step. Such movements of vertices are centered around a \"dense branch\" which is a path in the HC tree, where the internal nodes represent clusters whose sizes are bigger than their siblings.\n- The paper then considers a well-clustered graph which is composed of a given number of such high-conductance subgraphs (clusters), where the inter-cluster edges are more sparse than intra-cluster edges.\n\nOriginality: The paper contains novel ideas for performing theoretical analysis on HC algorithms and in particular for Dasgupta's objective. Some of the techniques used in the paper, including focusing on the \"dense branch\" and reconstructing trees by slighly modifying some of the branches, were also adopted by previous work, but this paper carefully managed to put them to good use, and, has found a nice breakthrough for HC-related theory, in my opinion. Analysis for Dasgupta's objective function often comes hand in hand with finding sparsest-cut, and the methods proposed in this paper at least offered a different perspective.\n\nThe submission seems to be technically sound. The writing quality is good. The underlying algorithms are quite complicated but the authors were able to at least convey the main ideas. In particular, they have motived the assumptions and the algorithm design very well.\n\nSignificance: The paper's main contributions are theoretical. Assuming it is correct, it adds to the community's understanding of HC objective functions and may contain some new tools that can be used for studying Dasgupta's objective. Emprically, the algorithm is on par with other algorithms developed in previous work. It does not outperform the most widey used HC algorithms yet, but the results may still enlighten us.\n\nMinor Comments:\n- In Algorithm 1, by definition, for some |V| values r could be very close to |V|? For example if |V| = 2^m + 1, does it mean r = |V| - 1? It seems a bit unusual then, since the algorithm splits off one point. I wasn't able to check the details due to time limits, but maybe the authors can share some intuition about why this is fine?\n- The intuition behind the algorithm is to group vertices of similar degrees first, which is also a bit non-intuitive, as I cannot really tell why it might give good HC trees at the high level. It might work in this context, but I wonder whether it is easily extendable.",
    "comment": " Many thanks for your time and the very positive opinion expressed in the review. We are also thankful for generously highlighting the original aspects and significance of our work. We have addressed each raised comment below. Please let us know if you have any further question and we will be happy to discuss them.\n\n\n==== The first minor comment ===\n\nThe answer to the both questions are yes; e.g., when $|V| = 2^a + 1$ for some $a \\geq 0$, we have that $r = |V| - 1$. However, in this case, this \"unusual\" split happens only at the top level. More generally, if $|V| = 2^a + b$, for $0 < b < 2^a$, at the root level the algorithm trims off the bottom $b$ vertices of the lowest degree which constitute $B$,  and then constructs the perfect binary tree $T_1$ on the vertices of $A$, which is merged with the tree $T_2$ formed on the vertices of $B$. Since $B$ contains the vertices of the lowest degree, in most cases the cost of the final tree $T_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ is (heavily) dominated by the cost of the tree $T_1$, hence the trimming at the top does not significantly contribute to the overall cost.\n\nMoreover, we want to emphasise that the final tree $T_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ exhibits several nice properties extensively used in our analysis, e.g., every internal node $A_i$ on the dense branch of $T_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ has size $|A_i| = 2^j$, for some $j$. Finally, we acknowledge an alternative construction where vertices are partitioned into two roughly equal sets at every level (including the root) might be possible. However, we believe this would add several technical nuances in the analysis that makes the overall presentation and proof more complicated.  \n\n==== The second minor comment ===\n\nThis is a very good question, and we believe that the construction based on grouping vertices according to their degrees cannot be extended to graphs with low conductance. To gain some intuition on why it works for high conductance graphs, consider the following scenario where $G$ is a graph of conductance $\\phi$ and suppose, for simplicity, that $|V| = 2^a$ for some $a > 0$. Consider an arbitrary HC-tree with the split $(A, B)$ at the root level such that $\\mathrm{vol}(A) \\geq \\mathrm{vol}(B)$. By the definition of volume and the fact that $G$ has conductance $\\phi$, we know that $\\phi \\cdot \\mathrm{vol}(B) \\leq w(A, B) \\leq \\mathrm{vol}(B)$. Therefore, up to a factor of $\\phi$, a small (or large) value of $\\mathrm{vol}(B)$ implies a small (or large) cut value $w(A, B)$. In our construction, we choose $B$ as the set of the $|V|/2$ vertices of the lowest degree. This ensures that: (1) the induced cut $(A, B)$ is balanced and (2) the set $B$ has smallest volume among all subsets of $|V|/2$ vertices, implying a small cut value $(A, B)$. Therefore, sequentially grouping the vertices in this fashion ensures that the cost induced at every level of the tree is not too large.",

    "review": "\nThe authors study the important problem of clustering graph in a hierarchical way optimizing an objective function introduced by Dasgupta [13]\u2028.\nThe authors study the problem under the assumption that the graph is well clusterable, in particular that it has high conductance (O(1)) this means that the graph is an expander and has no sparse cut separating two parts of the graph. Under this assumption they show a very fast near linear algorithm constant factor algorithm (while state of the art algorithm have logarithmic approximation and use complex poly time subroutines). Then they generalize this to well clustered graphs going beyond the stochastic block model to arbitrary graphs with this property.\n\nMoreover the paper is complemented with an empirical analysis. \n\nThe first structural observation is that if the graph has constant conductance and constant ratio of min max degree any tree is a constant approx solution. Then they introduce an algorithm which simply sorts nodes by degree and builds a tree balancing the nodes in order. Surprisingly this algorithm is a O(1/poly(conductance)) approximate despite being oblivious to the structure of the graph. \nThis suggests to me that getting a constant approximate hierarchical clustering of such graphs (despite the theoretical interest( is not an practically interesting result and as such the algorithm is not practically useful (expect as a building block).\nThen they adapt their algorithm to well clustered graphs using results from Trevisan et al. on finding sparse cuts. The algorithm is non trivial,\n\nThen they provide an empirical evaluation of their algorithm against standard heuristic baselines for HC and some algorithms with theoretical guarantees for special cases of the HC problem.  First they compare on synthetic SBM data where the performance ties with state of the art. On other synthetic data with multiple densities they improve over some baselines but the performance is tied with average linkage. Finally on real data their performance is better than some state off the art method (for HC in some objective and setting) but worse than the baselines of Average and complete linkage. \n\n\nMinor:\nvery interesting theoretical fact, -> perhaps just interesting.",
    "comment": "Many thanks for your time and helpful review of our work. We have addressed each of your specific points below. Please let us know if you have any further questions and we will be happy to discuss them.\n\n===== On the assumption of the well-clusterability =====\n\nWe highlight that our assumption of the well-clusterability and similar assumptions have been widely applied to characterise graphs occurring in practice (see the reference [14,18,22,23,26,27] of the submission). This is mainly because clustering is a hard problem to solve in general; on the other side, most instances for clustering that occur in practice usually exhibit a clear structure of clusters, so it\u2019s natural to study clustering problems under some well-clusterability assumption.\n\nFor the specific problem of hierarchical clustering, while achieving a constant-factor approximation  is SSE-hard for general graphs, our work shows that $O(1)$-approximation can be achieved in polynomial-time once the input graph is well-clustered. This is also appreciated by Reviewer Wup3, which comments that \"These results are in contrast to known hardness results which rule out constant factor approximation under rather natural assumptions\".\n\n===== Comparison with the baselines of average and complete linkage =====\n\nWe acknowledge your view that the experimental evidence shows that the output of our algorithm doesn't improve over simple baseline algorithms like average and complete linkage. However, we highlight that the objective of our work is to present algorithms with *theoretical approximation guarantees*; we remark that there are no theoretical guarantees for the above-mentioned linkage algorithms under Dasgupta\u2019s cost function.\n\n===== Wording issue=====\n\nWe will follow your suggestion, and drop \"very\" before \"interesting theoretical fact\".\n\n",

    "review": "My review is based on the supplementary material, because it seemed to me that the submission is simply a condensed version of the supplementary material. \n\nMy overall impression is overwhelmingly positive. It is written in good English, the structure of the paper is solid and I really appreciated the superb clarity of mathematical exposition, which is oftentimes lacking in machine learning papers. I have tried my best to do it justice with the review, although I must admit I was not familiar with the literature of group invariant models before reading this submission. I thank the authors for their work, and I apologise in advance for any misunderstandings on my part. \n\n[8] is important prior work, where Elesedy and Zaidi proved benefit in terms of expected risk of orbit-averaged linear solutions. This work extends their contributions by proving an analogous result for kernel ridge regression, which is a much more flexible regression technique. I tried to read up [8] as much as possible, and even though I am not familiar with the related work that came before [8], I am prepared to believe that no prior work proved the kind of generalisation benefits that [8] and the current submission provide, and if that is the case, I deem the contributions significant. I checked the proofs as much as I can, and although of course there may be things that I have missed, they look correct. Often in learning theory papers for RKHS-based regression, the input space is constrained to be compact, but I appreciated that they relaxed this assumption. I would have liked to give a higher overall rating than a 7, but I can't help thinking that the main original contributions came in [8], and this is rather an extension of that. But I do very much value the extension to kernel ridge regression. \n\nI foresee that some reviewers will not like the fact that no experiments have been conducted to validate the results, but I am prepared to argue that the theoretical contributions suffice for acceptance. \n\nSome additional points / questions:\n\n1) I'm a bit confused by the paragraph of lines 55-59. It says that Delta(f,f')>0 then f has strictly better test performance at f', but shouldn't it be the other way round, or \"larger test error than\"? This would be consistent with the rest of the paragraph, and also with the definition of Delta(f,f') in Section 4.2. \n2) Just a matter of exposition - it would be good if the displayed equation after line 105 had a full stop. \n3) On line 388, it is currently written iota:L_2(X,mu) -> H, which I imagine is not what the authors intended. In the proof of Lemma C.1, iota:H->L_2(X,mu) is correctly written. \n4) Lines 259-260 need to be re-written. \n5) In the displayed equations after lines 261 and 262, M needs to be M_k. \n6) In the displayed equations after line 290, the first and second lines on the right-hand side seem identical. \n7) The term \u201ceffective dimension\u201d was coined in [Optimal Rates for the Regularised Least-Squares Algorithm, Caponnetto and de Vito, 2007]; however, in that paper, it depends on the regulariser lambda (rho, in your notation) of kernel ridge regression, and is defined, if I\u2019m not mistaken, as the trace of (T+lambda)^{-1}T, where T, unlike your T_k, is the operator H -> H. So the order of composing the inclusion of H into L_2 and its adjoint is opposite to yours. \nFrom my limited knowledge and expertise, I think there is a case to be made for both; on the one hand, any kind of \u201cdimension\u201d of a space should be an inherent property of itself, and shouldn\u2019t depend on the regulariser used, which is a case for your definition, but then again, if the dimension is to take into account the functions considered for kernel ridge regression, then it does make sense that the amount of regularisation plays a role. I would be extremely grateful if the authors could comment on this difference, and also the fact that you consider the trace of T_k^2, whereas they consider (T+lambda)^{-1}T. I think it might still be worth using a different terminology, or at the very least mention the existing usage and explain how your definition is different. \n8) I am more familiar with the kernel literature, and I know that the assumptions that you placed on the kernels are not restrictive. However, I am not familiar with the group invariance literature, and I would be very grateful if you could just mention whether or not the assumptions you placed on G are not restrictive (e.g. that it is compact). Also, the assumption that the measure is supported on the whole of X seems crucial, since it is required for Lemma C.1 and thence the rest of the results, but this loses a little bit of generality.

    "review": "The paper shows an interesting theoretical effect of incorporating invariances on the reduction of generalization gap. Introducing the notion of effective dimensionality of kernels and its usage in bounding the reduction of generalization gap is a clear contribution of the paper.\nMy concern is that the presentation of the paper is quite abstract, and it is not clear how the theory can be applied to real applications. Unfortunately, the authors did not show any examples of invariance incorporation or experimental results, and it is hard to have an idea how well-known invariances can be formulated in terms of the equations in this paper. For example, the translation invariance in vision problem is a local property, and it depends on the point of interest. A single invariant transformation g\\in G (e.g. one tangent vector) does not apply globally to all data (in the data manifold) violating the assumptions in lines 80-81. \nFor the same reason, the condition for the target function f* in line 232 is too strong. In real problems, the invariance is a model that is not necessarily exist in true data-generating function or some invariances can be ignored by the model, so f* can be outside of (though can be close to) the invariant functions.\nAlso, the way to calculate the effective dimensionality in real problems is unclear. Given a kernel with invariance G, can the effective dimensionality be obtained?\nAll these questions arise because the authors did not present a concrete example and an experiment that confirms the theoretical derivation. Though the way to present the theoretical results is nice in this paper, the meaning of equations and its usefulness in real applications are limited.\n\n",
    "comment": "Thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our work. We welcome your suggestions for improvements.\n\nThe results of our work apply directly to the majority of the well known invariances in machine learning. The set of compact groups contains all finite groups (such as permutations or reflections) and many continuous groups such as rotations or translations on bounded subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ (such as an image). Combinations of such invariances are covered too. We can add this comment to the paper to improve the clarity of our submission.\n\nWe recognise and appreciate your comment on data dependent invariances. You are correct that in our framework (as with many prior works) invariance is a property of the target function $f$, rather than the function and a particular datum $(f, x)$. While we hope to address this in future works, we believe that our work regarding global invariances in the target function provide a genuine contribution to the literature.\n\nWe also recognise your comment on approximate invariance in the target function. This can be handled within our framework by adding a term to the generalisation bound that depends on how close the target function is to being invariant.

    "comment": "Thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our work. We very much welcome your suggestions for improvements.\n\nWe will review and address all of the applications of Fubini's theorem in the paper, providing explanation or further details wherever relevant. We thank you for suggesting this improvement to our paper. The version of Fubini's theorem we use is given in [1, Theorem 1.27].\n\nAs an example, regarding the display below L256, we take the following steps:\n- First $=$. Exchange finite sum and expectation.\n- Second $=$. Apply Fubini's theorem between $\\mu$ and the counting measure on $\\alpha$ (which is $\\sigma$-finite).  Note that all of the terms are non-negative.\n- Third $=$. Apply the definition of $\\tilde{e}^\\perp$. The sum converges absolutely because $T_k$ trace class (and and by the comparison test).\n- Fourth $=$. Use the definition of trace and commutation of $\\mathcal{O}$ and $T_k$.\n\nWe would be happy to add explanations such as these to the proofs to improve the clarity of our submission.\n\nRegarding your minor comments:\n- We will correct the typos you point out and the explanations you suggest, thank you.\n- The reference of Lemma 2: invariance is a special case of equivariance so the lemma applies. We will add this to the paper to improve clarity.\n- We believe that the analysis of the approximate symmetrisation can be handled by incorporating an additional term in the generalisation error that describes the rate of approximation. We will add this to the paper.\n\nWe thank you once again for your suggestions to improve our work and welcome any further questions or comments that you may have.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Olav Kallenberg.

    "review": "Obtaining finite-time bounds for the estimation of linear dynamical systems\u2014in both the setting where the state is observed and the state is unobserved\u2014has been a well-studied problem in the machine learning community over the last several years, and this works fits in that literature. A primary goal of existing works has been to obtain error bounds which do not scale with the \u201cmemory\u201d of the system, 1/(1-\\rho(A)). While achievable in the case where the state is observed, this has been a more difficult goal to reach in the case when the state is unobserved. Several existing works have addressed this\u2014for example, [1] introduces the notion of \"phase rank\" to avoid the memory dependence\u2014but it is not clear that the issue has been completely solved (phase rank could be exponential in the dimension in some cases, which is also highly undesirable). This work claims to remove the memory dependence without incurring poor dependence on other quantities, but is only able to do so in the case with 0 process noise.\n\nPros:\n- As noted above, removing the 1/(1-\\rho(A)) dependence is an important goal, and as yet has not been completely achieved in the case when the state is unobserved. As such, the problem considered here is relevant and, if solved, would be a contribution. \n- The authors do solve the problem in the case when the process noise is 0, eliminating the dependence on the memory in this setting.\n\nCons:\n- The primary issue with this paper is that the memory dependence can only be removed in the case when there is no process noise, i.e. the results improve on the state of the art only when there is no process noise. This is a very restrictive assumption, is likely unrealistic in practice, and it is not clear how interesting this setting is to the learning theory community (existing works have all assumed non-zero process noise). \n- Even in the noiseless setting, the memory dependence is not removed for the recovery of the system parameters (i.e. A,B,C,D) but only for the recovery of the impulse response. \n- The authors restrict to the case when \\rho(A) < 1 while existing works also encompass the case when \\rho(A) = 1. \n- The algorithm takes as input the memory length of the system, but it is not clear how one should actually set this without knowing the system parameters. \n- More care should be taken in comparing to [1]. [1] introduces the idea of phase rank, and provides bounds that scale with the phase rank instead of 1/(1-\\rho(A)) in some cases (even with non-zero process noise). No discussion of this is given\u2014it should be clarified what precisely the bounds in [1] work out to be, and what the actual memory dependence suffered is. At minimum the authors should not claim that no existing works obtain bounds that are memory-independent and should show explicit examples where their results improve over the phase rank dependence in [1]. \n\nWhile this work does make a contribution, the restrictive assumptions noted above and the fact that [1] partially solves the problem already are, in my opinion, significant enough that it does not warrant an accept. \n\n[1] Max Simchowitz, Ross Boczar, and Benjamin Recht.

    "comment": "After reading the reviewers\u2019 comments, I am willing to raise my score to a 5, as I believe the comparison with [1] is satisfactory. That the main novelty of this work (removing memory dependence) only holds when there is no process noise is still a major shortcoming to me and prevents me from raising my score any more. For future revisions of this work, I would suggest making the following changes, which could greatly strengthen the paper:\n\n- Add a lower bound showing that the memory dependence is in some cases necessary when there is process noise. Intuitively, it seems like this could be the case, as the memory is roughly the amount of time a single noise sample will affect the state. If one could show this, it would greatly strengthen the results here by showing they are effectively unimprovable, and really present a full story on memory dependence in system identification rates. \n- Along the same lines, it would be helpful to show through an example that existing algorithms suffer this memory dependence even when there is no process noise. I believe this is less necessary than my first suggestion, but would help justify the new algorithm proposed here.",

Space permitting, we will incorporate your suggestions in the revision.\n\n*The parameter recovery in Theorem 2.3 has an additional factor L, which is not clearly explained.*\n\nWe speculate that the factor of L comes from recovering system parameters from the SVD at a single scale. The challenge with using a multiscale approach here is that estimates of system parameters at different scales must be collated. We leave the possibility of improving this bound to future work.\n\n*\"It would be great if the magnitude of $\\epsilon_{\\text{trunc}}$ is mentioned.\"*\n\nCommonly, one assumes that $||CA^tB||\\le M\\rho^{t}$ for some $M$ and $\\rho$ (greater than or equal to the spectral radius of $A$). Then in the noiseless case, $\\epsilon_{\\text{trunc}}\\le M\\frac{\\rho^{2L-1}}{1-\\rho}\\sqrt{d_u}$. See the response to reviewer ZPKh for a way to modify the algorithm when these parameters are not known.\n\n*It would be useful to mention the computational complexity of the algorithm.*\n\nThe computational complexity of the algorithm (for $T\\gg d$) is determined by the complexity for the limiting step - solving the least squares problem for F - which takes time $O((Ld_u)^3 + LT^2d_ud_y) = O(LT^2d_ud_y)$ (with improvements if using fast matrix multiplication).\n",

I am also only superficially familiar with the implicit-model literature, but as far as I know analysing particular RL methods as preconditioners has mostly only been done in the options literature; this seems like a new take.\n\nThe paper was fairly easy to read, and the ideas here are well communicated. The empirical results link the theoretical claims to empirical claims, although very basic. I think that, without starting to solve Atari, more could have been done to illustrate the implications of the theorem. For example, one could repeat these experiments in the control case, or in the temporal difference case (while we shouldn't expect the theory to exactly hold, we may still observe effects which, in the long run, we would like to see in complicated environments).\n\nI usually write a long list of comments and nitpicking in my reviews, but this paper was fairly straightforward and I don't have much to add here.\n\nRebuttal update: I've read the other reviews and rebuttals and I'm inclined to keep my current score.

In particular, the algorithm clearly outperforms CoreSet, BADGE, Margin and Random on the Open Images dataset. The algorithm requires 29% less labels than the second-best model in the 100k batch-size setting and 60% less labels in the 1M batch-size setting to achieve the same result (mAP). Cluster-Margin also outperforms all other methods on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and obtains a similar performance on SVHN. \n    \n    The authors also establish a theoretical guarantee for the Cluster-MarginV algorithm and show that those results hold for the Cluster-Margin algorithm in specific settings. In particular, they show that the Cluster-MarginV algorithm has a label complexity bound which improves over the Margin algorithm by a factor beta. They also show that this improvement is possible, under specific hypotheses like an optimal volume-based sampler, when the dimensionality of the embedding space is small or when the batch size k is large. They also show that the optimal volume-based sampler is approximately equivalent to the Cluster-Margin algorithm. They finally show that log(k) is an upper bound on the improvement of query complexity for any sampler. \n    The authors are aware and mention that their theoretical results are initial and that equating volume based samplers and the Cluster-Margin algorithm is an open research question. \n    \n    Clarity: \n    The paper is very clear and well organized.

    "comment": "Thank you for your questions and comments. We will answer them individually below.\n\n---\n\n> My main issue is that more theoretical results could be empirically verified such as the superiority of the variance to expectation ratio for updates. Was it tried and not found conclusively?\n\nWe didn\u2019t think to try this since the experiments were designed to manipulate the components of the residual along the [1 1 \u2026 1]^T direction and not necessarily the ratio $(r_{max}/r_{min})^2$. However, to address the reviewer\u2019s concern, we reran our experiments and examined this ratio and the mean-var update ratio on the chain MDP and four rooms. We found that the reward offset has a weak effect on the ratio $(r_{max}/r_{min})^2$. As expected, the mean-var ratio under the implicit parameterization appears correlated with the ratio of residuals while under the explicit parameterization the mean-var ratio is unchanged, i.e., a flat curve.\n\nThese new results require computing many more gradients and are notably slower to run as currently implemented which is why the mountain car domain was not included (we ran into memory issues). We will fix the memory issues and add these figures, including mountain car, in the appendix of the final paper.\n\n> Theorem 1 is a bit unclear. The two updates in (4) that are claimed to hold, among them the first one is by choice as mentioned earlier in line 132 and it is not clear what the optimization procedure involved is for the implicit parameterization.

Depending on the choice of the optimizer, the evolution may follow different paths. Also, the theorem statement should explicitly contain this information instead of relying on text in the prior paragraph.\n\nBoth parameterizations are using (S)GD on the loss defined in (3) for the GD case and the loss defined above Corollary 2 for the SGD case. We will make sure this is stated more clearly.\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for the thoughtful feedback and corrections. We individually address each point bellow.\n\n---\n> A limitation of the results proved in the paper is that the questions it answers are all concerned with the optimization of the ERM loss, so it tells us essentially nothing about the generalization properties of the solutions found by the two parameterizations, even though the generalization abilities of end-to-end methods are the stated motivation for studying them.\n\nThe primary motivation for this work is the lack of theoretical understanding of end-to-end MBRL methods. We mention generalization when giving an overview of the kind of settings for which these types of methods have been proposed. By considering a simplified setting, our work identifies properties of the gradient dynamics of these methods inherent in the parameterization they induce. Although it most certainly would have been interesting to see results for some of these more complex settings, we believe our results serve as a useful first step towards better understanding these types of methods.\n\n> If my understanding is correct, the paper\u2019s result about (S)GD finding global optima tells us that the asymptotic solutions of the two parameterizations should be exactly the same if the global minimum of L(theta) is unique (which it will if the feature matrix X  has full rank). The corresponding (w, F) may not be unique, but any optimal solution would still have to induce the same theta.\n\nCorrect! This is an accurate summary of some of our results.\n\n> In experiments, it is interesting that the optimal eta can be different from the true gamma that generates the labels. However, no insight regarding how to set eta is provided.\n\nOur results provide some insight into the effect of eta on the gradient dynamics and overall behavior, but it is correct that it would be non-trivial to use those results to understand how best to set eta. It is not clear that this question would have a general answer using only the assumptions we\u2019ve made. We agree that this is an interesting observation. Prior work has made similar (theoretical) observations under a more conventional model-based setting where similar \u201cmismatched\u201d discount factors are analyzed [1]. However, it is unclear how applicable that line of work is given it primarily focuses on planning.\n\n[1] Jiang, Nan, et al. \"The dependence of effective planning horizon on model accuracy.\" Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. 2015.\n\n> In the experiments, do you stop running SGD before convergence? As mentioned above, my understanding is that the two parameterizations should converge to the same value, even if one converges more quickly than the other. However in the results there is a clear difference between the two.\n\nYour understanding about convergence is correct, and we are sorry not to have been clear about the fact that we run each method for a fixed number of updates.  The difference in performance in a fixed amount of time reflects, we believe, our theoretical results concerning the convergence rates of gradient descent under the different parameterization.\n\n> In (48) and (49), what is U? It seems that it should be A?\n\nYes, this should be A. We have fixed it in the revised manuscript. \n\n> In places you write \u201cif O(alpha^2_t) <= alpha^2_t C\u201d for some C>= 0. Is this not always true by the definition of the O notation?\n\nWe use the usual definition of the O notation. For example, in (4), as usual, the $\\mathcal{O}$ notation means that the absolute value of the error $\\hat \\theta_{(t+1)} - (\\hat \\theta_{(t)} -\\alpha_{(t)} P_{(t)}\\nabla L( \\hat \\theta_{(t)}))$ is at most some constant times $|\\alpha_{(t)}^2|$ when $\\alpha_{(t)}$ is close enough to zero. To clarify this point, we revised the paper by replacing \u201cif O(alpha^2_t) <= alpha^2_t C\u201d with the following: Let the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{(t)}^2)$ term be upper bounded by $C \\alpha_{(t)}^2$ for some $C\\ge0$. So, this means that $\\hat \\theta_{(t+1)} - (\\hat \\theta_{(t)} -\\alpha_{(t)} P_{(t)}\\nabla L( \\hat \\theta_{(t)})) \\le C \\alpha^2_t$.\n\n> The statement of Corollary 1 says that the learning rates alpha_t are given, but go from (7) to (8) you specify a value for alpha_t. Please justify.\n\nBy this, we did not mean that the learning rates alpha_t are given by external environments. What we meant by this is the following: given that the learning rates alpha_t are sufficiently small, the statement holds. Or equivalently, provided that the learning rates alpha_t are sufficiently small, the statement holds. In the proof, we are providing examples for the specific values of sufficiently small alphas that work for the convergence. To clarify this point, we revised the paper with a more concrete statement by replacing \u201cgiven a sufficiently small learning rate $\\alpha_{(t)}>0$\u201d by \u201cthere exists $\\bar C > 0$ such that with $\\alpha_{(t)}=\\bar C\\|\\nabla L(\\hat{\\theta}_{(t)})\\|_2^2$\u201d, which corresponds to the example constructed in the proof. \n\n> Equation (87) seems to have a typo (extra phi).\n\nYes, that\u2019s a typo, which we have fixed by deleting the extra phi\n\n> In (106), the index i is reused.\n\nThis is a typo. We fixed this by deleting the extra summation over the index i.\n\n> In the second-to-last step in the proof of Corollary 4, r_max should be squared since it is bounding r_i^2. (This seems to be just a typo, as the final result has r_max^2).\n\nCorrect, this is a typo. We have fixed this by replacing the r_max by the r_max^2 there. \n",

    "comment": "Thanks for the positive evaluation of this work and the detailed comments. \n\n### Q1: Maybe one or two additional examples from other domains could make the motivation even stronger.\nA1: Thanks for the suggestion. There are plenty of \u201cpicky-customer\u201d examples besides the discussed autonomous driving example, to list a few: (1) medical treatment must take care of every patient even in very rare health conditions; (2) an education system should accommodate every student according to his/her own characteristics; and (3) emergency response systems have to be responsible in all extreme cases. We will strengthen our motivation with more examples in our next version. \n\n### Q2: Demonstrating how existing solutions for the single-objective case cannot be used in the multi-objective case when the preferences are designed adversarially (since they would suffer $O(K)$ regret) is important in motivating the need for a new algorithm.\nA2: Good suggestion! We plan to move Figure 1 into Section 1 to emphasize that MORL needs new efficient algorithms. We will also add a detailed description for the experiment. In particular, the \u201cbest-in-hindsight\u201d policy refers to a policy that is fixed across episodes and achieves maximum cumulative rewards in the whole game, i.e., $ \\arg\\max\\_{\\pi} \\sum\\_{k=1}^K V^{\\pi}\\_1(x\\_1; w^k)  $. \nIn the single-objective RL setting, this is the optimal solution of the underlying MDP; however in the multi-objective RL setting, this could be much worse than a time-varying policy, e.g., $ \\max\\_{\\pi} \\sum\\_{k=1}^K V^{\\pi}\\_1(x\\_1; w^k) \\leq \\sum\\_{k=1}^K V^\\*_1(x\\_1; w^k) $. \n\nIn experiments, the information-theoretically adversarial preferences are computationally infeasible to compute; in Figure 1 we simply use a randomly generated set of preferences, for which the \u201cbest-in-hindsight\u201d policy already performs poorly.\n\n### Q3: In Remark 2 (line 183), it is mentioned that Theorem 1 can be extended to more general cases. Does this mean that any arbitrary deterministic function $f$ such that $r = f ( \\mathbf{r}; w)$ can be accommodated?\nA3: Our results apply to any scalarization function $r = f (\\mathbf{r}; w) $ that is (1) deterministic, (2) Lipschitz continuous for $w$, and (3) bounded between $[0,1]$ (which can be relaxed). We have not yet explored under what conditions stochastic scalarization functions can be covered, which could be an interesting future direction. We will clarify this in our next version.\n\n\n### Q4: Corollary 5 gives a regret bound for the case when the MDP is non-stationary. Is this true for any arbitrary forms of non-stationarity? \nA4: As explained in footnote 5 in page 8, the non-stationary (episodic) MDP means episodic MDP with varying (instead of fixed) transition probability at different steps (within one episode). This additional difficulty of non-stationary vs. stationary (episodic) MDP stems from the fact that: the former requires to estimate $H$ transition probabilities ${P_1, \\dots, P_H}$, while the latter only requires to estimate one single $P$. This typically only adds up a certain $H$ multiplicative factor in the obtained bounds.\n\nYes, Theorem 3 can be extended to non-stationary MDP as well. In this case the obtained bound will be updated with an additional $H$ multiplicative factor. \n\n\n\n### Q5: Preference-free exploration can be applied to the setting of task-agnostic exploration is not immediately clear to me.\nA5: For our PFE algorithm, we can set $d = 1$ to obtain an algorithm for TAE with a single agnostic task, where we have $\\min\\\\{d,S\\\\} = 1$. Then we can extend this algorithm to TAE with $N$ agnostic tasks using a union bound to have the algorithm succeed simultaneously for all $N$ tasks, which adds a $\\log N$ multiplicative factor in the sample complexity bound. In this way our PFE algorithm can be converted to a TAE algorithm, and the obtained bounds have $\\min\\\\{d,S\\\\}$ replaced with $\\log N$.\n\nThe above argument applies to any PFE algorithm that does not exploit the given reward basis $\\mathbf{r}$ during exploration, which includes our PFE algorithm. We will add a proposition to formally explain this. \n",

    "comment": "Thanks for appreciating our contributions and the paper presentation.\n\n### Q1: The numerical simulation seems to be unfair for single-objective RL. How about comparing it to the task-agnostic algorithm?\nA1: The aim of the numerical simulation is to illustrate that existing single-objective RL algorithms cannot be directly applied in our setting.\n\nSince TAE algorithms and PFE algorithms can be converted to each other (as explained in line 302-310), we agree it makes sense to compare the empirical performance of our algorithm to a PFE version of the TAE algorithm in [2]. We will include such an experiment in the next version.\n\n### Q2: Most of the theoretical analysis follows from the previous work.\nA2: Indeed we use some standard techniques to derive our bounds. However we would like to emphasize that both the considered MORL problem settings and results are new. It requires non-trivial efforts to establish the new algorithms. Moreover, the construction of the lower bound instances is based on a novel application of the Johnson\u2013Lindenstrauss lemma, which is of independent interest in the field. \n\n### Q3: The results are derived based on the assumption that all the preference weights are bounded between [0,1]. It is not clear whether the results hold when the weights are negative.\nA3: The assumption that weights are bounded in $[0,1]$ is only made for convenience. Our results naturally apply to weights bounded in $[-C, C]$, where $C$ can be any absolute positive constant. Therefore our results hold even for negative weights. We will clarify this in the next version. \n\n\n\n",

    "submission_title": "Sample Selection with Uncertainty of Losses for Learning with Noisy Labels",
    "review": "The sample selection approach is popular and useful in learning with noisy labels. Motivated by the fact that deep networks first memorize the training data with clean labels, the training data with small losses can be seen as clean data and used for optimization. This paper considers the uncertainty of losses in the sample selection procedure, which consists of two aspects: the uncertainty of small-loss data and the uncertainty of large-loss data. The authors use the concentration inequalities and confidence bounds to study these uncertainties at the same time. The experiments in this paper are comprehensive. The results are also promising, especially when the training data are noisy and imbalanced. \n\nStrength\n- Strong motivation. This paper is motivated by experimental results, which show that sometimes the loss values cannot fully reflect the purity of an example. When the data are noisy and imbalanced, the losses of mislabeled data and clean imbalanced data are almost equal and hence cannot be used directly for sample selection. Besides, the loss achieved at a certain epoch may not be trusted. The results are clear and well motivate this paper. \n- Great writing. The logic of this paper is smooth. The authors first reveal the issues of prior effects and then present the proposed method step by step. Most of the technical details are described clearly. \n- Theory. This paper provides theoretical analyses for two robust mean estimators, which could guide the process of sample selection during training. \n- Experiments. The experiments of this paper are comprehensive. The authors consider five types of synthetic label noise and real-world label noise, following good experimental results. Detailed experimental analyses and ablation study are also provided. \n\nWeakness/Question\n- Learning with noisy imbalanced data is challenging.

    "comment": "Thanks for your review and suggestions! We will answer the questions one by one.\n\n**Q1:** Would the results on the other datasets be similar to the case on IM-MNIST?  \n**A1:** Yes. We exploit the results of IM-MNIST for our motivation. The results on the other imbalanced datasets are similar to the case on IM-MNIST, i.e., the clean but imbalanced data have large losses, which makes prior sample selection methods not work well. In Section 3.2, the experiments on IM-F-MNIST also confirm our claims. \n\n**Q2:** The experimental results when the proposed methods are built on other sample selection methods.  \n**A2:** We study the uncertainty of losses which are built on MentorNet and S2E. Let us describe the experiments in detail. \n- The experiments are conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and IM-MNIST. The noise rate is set to 40%.\n- We use \u201cMentorNet-S(H)\u201d (resp. S2E-S(H)) to denote that MentorNet (resp. S2E) is boosted with our methods. \n- The experimental results are shown in Table 2-1 and 2-2. With the study of the uncertainty of losses, the methods based on the small-losses trick can be enhanced clearly, especially on IM-MNIST, which supports our claims well.\n\n| Methods | Sym. 40\\% (MNIST) | Asym. 40% (MNIST) | Pair. 40% (MNIST) | Trid. 40% (MNIST) | Ins. 40% (MNIST) | Asym. 40% (IM-MNIST)|\n| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |\n| MentorNet | 92.08$\\pm$0.42 | 90.86$\\pm$0.97 | 90.93$\\pm$1.54 | 93.28$\\pm$1.37 | 90.11$\\pm$1.26 | 50.39$\\pm$7.84 |\n| MentorNet-S |  **93.52$\\pm$0.41** | **91.33$\\pm$0.50** | **92.06$\\pm$0.67** | **94.06$\\pm$0.66** | **91.35$\\pm$0.90** | **60.12$\\pm$3.06**|\n| MentorNet-H | **93.07$\\pm$0.66** | **90.95$\\pm$0.84** | **92.08$\\pm$0.78** | **93.29$\\pm$1.04** | **92.03$\\pm$0.92** | **61.52$\\pm$4.18** | \n| S2E | 95.62$\\pm$0.91 | 98.45$\\pm$0.26 | 94.22$\\pm$0.79 | 97.23$\\pm$1.26 | 94.02$\\pm$2.39 | 51.42$\\pm$13.04 |\n| S2E-S | **95.73$\\pm$0.85** | **98.76$\\pm$0.33** | **94.72$\\pm$0.90** | **97.64$\\pm$0.29** | **94.73$\\pm$0.92**| **59.77$\\pm$6.34**|\n| S2E-H | **95.77$\\pm$0.62** | **98.66$\\pm$0.29** | **94.83$\\pm$0.63** | **97.64$\\pm$0.58** | **94.69$\\pm$1.70**| **58.72$\\pm$6.06**|\n\nTable 2-1: The test accuracy (%) on noisy MNIST and IM-MNIST. \n\n| Methods | Sym. 40\\% | Asym. 40%| Pair. 40% | Trid. 40% | Ins. 40% | \n| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |\n| MentorNet | 74.67$\\pm$1.17 | 71.69$\\pm$1.06 | 69.39$\\pm$1.73 | 71.56$\\pm$0.93 | 68.17$\\pm$2.52 |\n| MentorNet-S | **75.61$\\pm$0.93** | **72.03$\\pm$0.93** | **69.89$\\pm$1.50** | **72.33$\\pm$0.55** | **69.33$\\pm$1.29** |\n| MentorNet-H | **74.88$\\pm$1.00** | **71.87$\\pm$1.06** | **70.09$\\pm$1.31** | **71.77$\\pm$1.06** | **68.57$\\pm$2.19** |\n| S2E | 69.72$\\pm$3.94 | 75.04$\\pm$1.24 | 61.50$\\pm$4.63 | 64.39$\\pm$2.82 | 62.42$\\pm$3.11 | \n| S2E-S | **72.72$\\pm$2.06** | **75.22$\\pm$0.93** | **65.29$\\pm$2.73** | **66.78$\\pm$1.37** | **66.77$\\pm$1.30** |\n| S2E-H | **72.84$\\pm$1.58** | **75.17$\\pm$0.88** | **65.43$\\pm$2.04** | **67.69$\\pm$2.31** | **65.82$\\pm$2.95** |\n\nTable 2-2: The test accuracy (%) on noisy CIFAR-10.\n\n**Q3:** The concerns about the hyperparameters of the proposed methods.  \n**A3:** We justify the claims of using hyperparameters.\n- Although the hyperparameters make the methods more complex, the use of hyperparameters aims to reduce the dependency on strong assumptions and thus make our methods perform well in practice. \n- The experiments on real-world label noise datasets could verify the effectiveness of our methods. \n- We will discuss the strong assumptions which are used for estimating $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ and their limitations in our final paper. \n\n**Q4:** The experiments on Clothing1M with a pre-trained ResNet-50 network structure.   \n**A4:** We conduct the experiments on Clothing1M to further justify our claims.

    "review": "Distinguishing between mislabeled examples and hard examples is a fundamentally difficult problem and worthwhile to investigate.\n\nThe key idea is to incorporate the uncertainty of losses by adopting interval estimation instead of point estimation of losses.  This idea is definitely reasonable, but is not totally new.  Although the details are different, batch selection based on uncertainty has been actively discussed in this field.  For example, refer to ActiveBias (NeurIPS 2017).\n\nThe assumption that the loss conforms to a Markov process is not reasonable.  Thus, Theorem 2 based on this assumption may not work well with a real loss function.\n\nMy main concern is on the experiments.  The authors argue that they did not compare the proposed algorithms with the state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., SELF and DivideMix), because they focus on sample selection mechanisms.  I understand the authors' intention.  However, I believe that this is not acceptable for this top-tier conference, because the proposed algorithms should be proven to improve the cutting edge performance.

    "comment": "Thank you for your constructive comments and suggestions! We will answer all the questions.\n\n**Q1:** More discussions on related work ActiveBias (NeurIPS 2017) are needed.   \n**A1:** Thank you for mentioning this interesting and solid paper, which exploits lightweight estimates of sample uncertainty to improve generalization. In general, the differences between our work and ActiveBias lie in the different problems, different focuses, and different technical implementation. In more detail, we summarize the main differences between the two works.   \n- ActiveBias mainly focuses on mining hard examples to help generalization. Although it mentions the label-noise problem, it does not consider comprehensive noise settings. Also, the baselines are SGD, ADAM, and other optimization methods, but not the methods are specially designed for learning with noisy labels. In contrast, our work mainly focuses on learning with noisy labels and has more comprehensive experiments, which explore the performance of different label-noise methods under noisy supervision.  \n- ActiveBias focuses on using the hard examples, but not too difficult examples, which is stated in the original paper. In the imbalanced setting of this paper, clean imbalanced data are too difficult to distinguish with the predictions of models (Figure 1 right) and therefore are too difficult examples. Our methods aim to make use of such examples. Experiments show that such examples are of great importance for generalization.\n- The introduction of uncertainty in ActiveBias relies on the estimation of the prediction variance but does not consider the bad influence of mislabeled data/outliers on this estimation. Our methods use the loss distribution and the side effect of mislabeled data is considered by robust mean estimators. \n\n**Q2:** The reasonability of the assumption that the loss conforms to a Markov process.  \n**A2:** We justify the reasonability of the assumption that the loss conforms to a Markov process.\n- The assumption for Theorem 2 is inspired by the modern optimization method for deep neural networks, e.g., SGD and Mini Batch SGD, where the weights of a network in the next iteration only depend on the weights in the current iteration. \n- Although some optimization methods, e.g., AdaDelta and Adam, exploit the momentum which uses the gradients in multiple iterations to stabilize or speed up training, the weight updates still mainly rely on the weights in the last iteration. \n- This assumption is built on the training loss but does not rely on a specific loss function.\n- A series of experimental results, especially for the results on real-world label-noise datasets, justify the reasonability of this assumption.\n\n**Q3 & Q5:** The main concerns on more experiments for comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, more experiments on real-world label-noise datasets are needed.  \n**A3 & A5:** We agree with your opinion and have taken your valuable advice. We compare our methods with the SOTA method, i.e., DivideMix [1], which has released codes (https://github.com/LiJunnan1992/DivideMix). Let us describe the experiments in detail. \n- We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets, i.e., Food-101, Webvision (mini), and Clothing1M, which are popularly used in learning with noisy labels.\n- We use the reported performance in [1] for Webvision (mini) and Clothing1M. We test the performance of DivideMix on Food-101 by using a pre-trained ResNet-50 model.\n- We follow the paradigm of DivideMix and replace its GMM model with our methods for sample selection. Other settings stay the same.\n- The results are provided in Table 1-1. DivideMix-S (resp. DivideMix-H) means that our CNLCU-S (resp. CNLCU-H) is combined with the advanced techniques in DivideMix.\n- By combining the advanced techniques as did in DivideMix, the robustness of models can be further improved. In some cases, the improvement may be not very significant. This is because: (1) It is harder to gain significant improvement on challenging real-world datasets (see [2]), especially in the comparison with the strong baseline DivideMix; (2) We do not tune the combination of advanced techniques finely and only use the proposed sample selection paradigm with them. \n- Consistent improvements in multiple cases show that the proposed algorithms could improve the cutting edge performance.\n\n\n| Methods / Datasets | Food-101 | Webvision (mini) | Clothing1M |\n| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |\n| DivideMix | 86.73 | 77.32 | 74.76 |\n| DivideMix-S | **86.92** | **77.53** | **74.90** |\n| DivideMix-H | **86.88** | **77.48** | **74.82** |\n\nTable 1-1: The test accuracy (%) on three real-world datasets. \n\n----\n[1] Junnan Li et al.

    "comment": "We appreciate your valuable advice. We will explain your questions below.\n\nQ1: Question about Fig. 7.\n\nA1: MGG models the prior knowledge of the player's strategy, predicts the corresponding macro-goal as the condition, and combines the intrinsic reward to improve the efficiency of the macro strategy exploration. However, we still retain the external reward used in RL-baseline to guide the agent to explore the optimal way to achieve the strategy. Therefore, the macro-state of MGG is closer to humans than that of RL-baseline, but it is still different from humans.\n\nQ2: Question about Fig. 8.\n\nA2: In the case study, all human evaluations are obtained by counting 1,000 human games. In these games, the opponents of the special lineup system are high-rank human players. However, the opponents of RL-baseline, GAIL, MGG are RL-baseline using the regular lineups. Due to the gap in the strength of opponents, there will be differences in indicators between humans and MGG, but MGG is still closer to human than other methods.\n\nQ3: About human-machine test.\n\nA3: Since the players participating in the test include all ranks, the average ability (e.g. micro-operation) is much lower than the RL-baseline. Even esports players of similar strength have been defeated by RL-baseline (Keywords: The Tencent Wukong AI system, The World Champion Cup of 'Honour Of Kings', Kuala Lumpur, August 7, 2019). Almost all testers can only defeat AI through some special strategies, and the values of these strategies are very different from the general reward, so it is difficult to be explored by RL-baseline in self-play training. MGG has learned a lot of human macro strategies and is able to deal with some special strategies. Experiments have also proved that it is slightly better than RL-baseline when facing various human player strategies.\n\nIn addition, the human-machine test requires a lot of matches and preparation costs (Line 242), so it is difficult to conduct multiple tests in a short time. However, Fig. 6b shows the cumulative winning percentage. From 12h to 26h, we have counted 15 times for the winning percentage. There is always a gap between the winning percentages of MGG and RL-baseline, and the gap is gradually increasing. It can be ruled out that the difference is caused by statistical errors.\n\nQ4: Clarifications on Meta-Controller convergence.\n\nA4: Yes, we mean that the model has converged at 100w steps, and then we use the model for macro-goal prediction.\n\nQ5: Question about human values in Table 3.\n\nA5: For Resource-Grab System, assassins are generally very strong in the early stage and weaker in the late stage. Therefore, human players usually grab the enemy's monster resources as soon as possible based on the situation of the investigation, thereby opening up the resource gap between the two sides in the early stage. At this time, the goal can be expressed as a combination of moving to the enemy jungle areas, attacking the enemy's monster resources, and raising the level. For Table 3, the value of \"Human\" is obtained by counting 1000 high-rank human games under the Resource-Grab System.\n\nQ6: Clarifications about the participants.\n\nA6: The instructions given to participants are in-game announcements. The in-game rewards given to participants are the currency in the game and can be exchanged for props. The human-machine test is presented as a challenging activity in the game, which players voluntarily choose to participate in.",

    "review": "# Overview\n\n\"Learning Diverse Policies in MOBA Games via Macro-Goals\" presents a compelling direction for combining offline human feedback with a reinforcement learning policy, and the evaluation criteria investigating exploitability is novel and supports the paper's stated goals. Certain areas of the paper require work to help the reader reproduce the results or understand the significance of the outcomes. \n\n# Originality\n\nThe paper's combination of human data using imitation learning and reinforcement learning has been previously explored in the context of 'human preferences' and summarization work. The approach is novel in the context of MOBA games and demonstrates that in long-action sequences this form of supervision is applicable and can lead to demonstrably more diverse policies.\n\nThe choice of neural network, features, domain, and other aspects are not the focus of the paper, and are also not novel.\n\nThe paper measures the exploitability of the agents using human evaluations (Figure 6) and this evaluation format has not been used previously in the context of learning game AI policies. This test, while difficult to reproduce, serves as an invaluable showcase for the method's impact on realistic play. \n\n# Clarity\n\nThe paper's stated goals and application domain is clearly stated. Similarly, the purpose of the experiments is explained and motivated. Certain results and their applicability hinder the reading and contextualization of the work. As an example, 4.4.3 discusses capability analysis while using ELO scores. The compared approaches are stated to be 'converged', however this term is loaded and hard to transfer across architectures and setups. Similarly the results in Figure 6 and 9 do not provide statistical significance of the results, or potentially a comparison across different points during training (as a way of further confirming that the systems have indeed converged). As such, the conclusions from many of these experiments are hard to measure. A key question that should be answered is: \"does using human games and an additional goal reward in this way provide better results provided with the same resources/time/energy as our reinforcement learning baseline?\". Ideally a good control would allow the reinforcement learning policy to train supervised from human trajectories and then train with self-play, and account for the additional parameters and training time required by the imitation training.\n\nSection 4.4.1 Why is achieving \"resource intent strategies\" important? Does the trained policy *need* to be good at this to improve at the game, or is the purpose to be as similar to human play?\n\nSection 4.4.2 discusses human performance for monster resources: what is this human evaluation? how are they chosen? How many attempts are done by humans? Are these humans professional or amateur players?\n\n# Significance\nThe proposed approach is tested on a challenging benchmark and uses significant resources to train the agents and evaluate them.\nThe significance of this work is limited by two key factors: 1) research in this area is important, but the proposed technique is hard to reproduce owing to the high computational cost, lack of a public interface or system to test and train Honor of Kings agents. 2) the results are provided without statistical significance numbers or selection criteria for human players. The ELO numbers and reward scores should ideally be amended in the final version of the paper with some measure to understand the size of the gains over GAIL or RL-Baseline. The human player performance is hard to asses, and perhaps an ELO score for human players, or a description of the selection process would help. (specifically the exploitability plot in Figure 6 strongly depends on the kind of players that tested either agent, and whether they were allowed to play against either system, or only one kind repeatedly, etc.)\n\n# Areas for improvement\n\n## Statistical significance:\nFigure 6 and Figure 9 provide the most impressive results of the paper, but lack any statistical significance metrics which would help understand the gains between RL-baseline, GAIL, and MGG.\n\n## Wording:\nL249 \"this test effectively proves\" I would reword this as \"this test suggests\" or \"provides evidence for\" as conclusive demonstrations with human testing and a limited number of samples are unlikely, but do provide a great benchmark.\nL259, L265 \"marco states\" -> \"macro states\"\n\n## Citation style:\nOpenAI Five citation should preferably use https: //openai.com/bibtex/openai2019dota.bib (e.g. OpenAI et al.)\n\n## Related Work:\nL78 \"All the mentioned works except the SL model adopt a single strategy regardless of the\n79 heroes and lineups, which cannot take full advantage of heroes and lineups\u2019 characteristics\" -> Slight correction: OpenAI Five has a latent vector encoding lane preferences + a representation of the heroes that affect the employed strategy, so in practice the strategy will change dramatically between games when those aspects are randomized.",
    "comment": "Thank you very much for your valuable advice and we will definitely improve the presentation and result description soon. For your questions, modified expressions, and experimental supplements, we will show below.\n\nQ1: About model capability convergence in section 4.4.3.\n\nA1: To make a fair comparison, we use exactly the same framework, settings, computational resources to train RL-baseline, GAIL, and MGG. Other than that, the only difference is that MGG = RL-baseline + macro goal (feature) + intrinsic reward, GAIL = RL-baseline + discriminator + adversarial reward. In order to judge the model is \u2018converged\u2019, we use the models at different time points to play against each other every day, and then calculate the ELO until it does not change. Therefore, it can be considered that under the same resources, the 'converged' model has reached the upper limit of its ability. Due to length limitations, we did not show the ELO results at different time points during training.\n\nQ2: Questions about the results of ELO and the gains compared to other methods.\n\nA2: As shown in Line 238, we use all methods to play pairwise matches, 400 games each pair, and then calculate the ELO scores. All lineups in each match are randomly selected from the 102 hero pool, that is, any lineup system. For the rigor of the experiment, we used different random seeds to select heroes and supplemented 20 experiments. The error range of the final ELO is \u00b1 30 points. Therefore, the ELO score can indicate the gain of MGG over GAIL and RL-baseline under different lineup systems.\n\nIn addition, the appendix (Sections A.1.2, A.1.3) also shows some tests with high-rank players. It can be seen that under some special lineup systems, MGG has a significant improvement over RL-baseline.\n\nQ3: Question about computational resources and time.\n\nA3: Our main goal is for the model to learn diverse macro strategies while maintaining a high level of micro-operations (Line 65-67). And the secondary goal is to improve the competitive ability of the model by increasing the diversity of strategies (Line68-70). Therefore, we are more focused on whether using the same computational resources can improve the model's strategy diversity and competitive ability, rather than time. Under the same computational resources, the increase in training time cannot continue to improve the ability of RL-baseline, so the ELO comparison of the converged models provides evidence for the effectiveness of MGG.\n\nQ4: The importance of \"resource intent strategies\" in Section 4.4.1.\n\nA4\uff1aIn the Marksman-Core System, there is a very powerful marksman. In order to maximize the ability of the lineup, human players will allocate more resources to the marksman to open up the advantage, but RL-baseline will not. Therefore, the policy can only improve in the game if it remains similar to humans in terms of resource intent.\n\nQ5: Question about the human evaluation for monster resources in Section 4.4.2.\n\nA5: We have counted a total of 1,000 human games using the Resource-Grab System. Both sides of the game are high-rank players in Honor of Kings.\n\nQ6: Question about competitive performance evaluation of human players.\n\nA6: The human-machine test is open to all players in Honor of Kings, from amateur to professional players. And MGG and RL-baseline are randomly selected as opponents (Line 243-245). Both human players and AI can choose any hero from the 102 hero pool, and humans can use any lineup system to fight against the AI. In addition, we also conducted 50,000 human-machine tests on the SL model, and the winning rate against humans was 93.10%. Therefore, we can also calculate the ELO scores for human players, and the final score is no-op (0) < Built-in bot (959) < human (1788) < SL (2183) < RL-Baseline (2851) < MGG (3048).\n\nQ7: About Wording, Citation style, Related Work, Limitations.\n\nA7: We will modify it in subsequent versions.",

    "review": "Overall, the paper presents a novel method for pushing the state of the art of AI performance in MOBA games. The large-scale human study to evaluate performance against baselines and the performance exceeding the state-of-the-art baselines clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MGG method. Specific analyses also support the diversity claims made about the learned strategies. However, the paper in its current state leaves a lot to be desired in terms of clarity, broader motivation and accessibility. Despite the thorough empirical analysis made in this paper, it remains inaccessible to the reader due to these writing issues. \n \nBelow are detailed comments on the strengths and weaknesses that informed my evaluation of the paper.\n \n \n## Strengths\n \n1. The presented MGG method\u2019s main selling point is the diversity in strategies that are aimed to improve performance against human matchups, since humans are capable of overcoming unimodal/repetitive strategies by AI agents given enough time and practice. The claim for diversity in the proposed method is supported by a quantitative analysis with measurements of goal-entropy and Davies-Bouldin Index of the goal embeddings, and a qualitative analysis of specific cases of non-conventional strategies in the chosen game (Honor of Kings) which typically do not align with the default reward models proposed for this game.\n \n2. The large scale human-study with human vs AI matches clearly demonstrates that the proposed method retains performance (w.r.t the baseline) with increasing human test time, which is in line with the hypothesis that diverse strategies are better than unimodal strategies against human matchups.\n \n3. The choice of using expert demonstrations for learning only the high-level macro-goal prediction network is intuitively appealing -- it aims to mimic broader human intentions without worrying about matching the exact execution of each intention.\n \n4. For readers that are familiar with MOBA games, the two case studies in Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 (and the videos linked in the paper) are impressive demonstrations of what the proposed method is capable of in practice. Such strategies seem to be very difficult to learn for AI agents but are easy or obvious for human players.\n \n\n\n## Weaknesses\n \n\n#### Lack of clarity in method description.\n\n1. The second paragraph in Section 3 is confusing due to lack of proper explanation and use of arbitrary new notation. The difference between macro states and macro goals is not clear. The role of f i.e. the macro state extraction function is not made clear until much later in the paper. The \u201cgeneral reward function\u201d is never explained -- what does this mean and what does it consist of? What does the \u201ccommon strategy\u201d mean? Why is notation introduced for human macro states when this notation is never used again in the entire paper (i.e. served no purpose later on). It could have been explained without any notation. In my opinion, the goal space should be completely defined at this stage of the paper, along with the choice of goal dimension and a description of what the dimensions of the goal specify. Also, notation for intrinsic reward R(f(S), G, A) is introduced without being accompanied by a definition (the definition is much later in the paper).\n\n2. Auxiliary tasks are first mentioned in L135 but what auxiliary tasks are used is not mentioned until L173. Since only a single auxiliary task of auto-encoding is used, this explanation does not deserve to be pushed to such a later stage from it\u2019s first mention.\n\n3. L161 states that C is the number of frames between state and its goal, but it is not made clear how C is specified. Later in the paper, C is then stated to be a hyperparameter which has a fixed value. This description about C being a hyperparam of choice and its value should all be in the same first mention of C in the paper.\n\n4. Equation 2 (and L192 below it) assume that the goal space admits a metric in the form of an L1 norm, but the goal space is not defined at this point in the paper. There is an implicit assumption that the goal space is a multi-dimensional euclidean space (R^d).\n \n\n#### Accessibility. \n\n1. The paper does not introduce key MOBA-specific terminology before using it at several points in the paper. A basic explanation of the mechanics, heros and progression milestones of the game should be explained before terms like \u201cdestroying the crystal\u201d, \u201cover 102 heroes\u2026\u201d or \u201cban/pick capabilities\u201d are used. However, given that this paper specifically focuses solely on MOBA games, this is a minor issue.\nThe paper mentions \u201cleague based\u201d methods in the intro (L43 and L66) but does not explain what this category of prior work means until L81, where a very vague explanation is presented -- \u201cleague-based methods train multiple agents simultaneously to explore strategy space and require massive computation\u201d.\n\n2. The \u201cgeneral reward function\u201d is mentioned several times in the paper but only introduced on L274 after citing Ye et al. [2020a] without any description. This seems to be an important fact to include in the paper well in advance.\nThe fact that the proposed method is an instance of an imitation learning method where expert data is used is not made clear during comparisons with baselines. It is not mentioned that the \u201cRL-baseline\u201d method does not use any human supervision, which is an important point to note in the comparison.\n \n\n#### Empirical issues.\n\n1. For the main result of AI vs human win rate obtained from the large scale human study, the Y-axis range in Figure 6 (b) seems to be extremely narrow (98.72% - 98.86%). Due to the absence of error bars, it is very difficult to judge the statistical significance of the presented results. It is also very surprising that the RL-baseline, despite lacking diversity, is able to retain such a high win rate after 26 hours of accumulated human test time. This seems to strongly oppose the premise of the paper that humans can easily overcome AI strategies if they lack diversity.\n\n2. Lack of error bars: Figures 6, 9 and Tables 1,2,3 lack error bars, despite the authors having answered \u201cYes\u201d to the checklist question about whether they have included error bars.\n \n\n## Other minor errors\n\n1. L259 -- A brief explanation of the Davies-Bouldin Index and its relevance should be presented instead of just citing the original paper.\n2. Last line of Conclusions seems very vague, what does \u201cnon-transitivity in strategies\u201d mean? The directions for future work can be made more clear.\n3. Table 2 and Section 4.3.2 mention measuring \u201cstate entropy\u201d. Shouldn\u2019t this be called \u201cmacro state entropy\u201d instead?\n",
    "comment": "Thank you for your valuable suggestions. We feel sorry for the lack of a clear description of the definition and explanation of the symbol, and we will definitely be able to modify it based on comments in a short time. Below are some demos we modified, hoping to share our work with the MOBA game AI community.\n\nQ1\uff1aModified demo of Section 3.\n\nA1: According to your suggestion, we add a detailed description of the symbol. Then, explain the knowledge related to RL-baseline earlier.\n\n> In particular, we introduce $G$ which represents the macro strategic states space in the game, which is a multi-dimensional Euclidean space. And we also define a macro state extraction function $f:S \\rightarrow G$ for mapping the current state $s$ to the macro state $c=f(s)$. The macro state $c \\in G$ mainly includes the region state (e.g. the area on the map) and resource state (e.g. unit resource, gold, level) related to strategy. The macro goal $g \\in G$ represents the macro state that the current strategy should achieve in the future. \n\n> Ye et al. [2020a]\u00a0design the general reward function for MOBA games, including farming, KDA, damage, pushing, and win/lose related rewards. As a result of the single value, the policy only learns the common strategy from self-play training, that is, farming first, then fighting and pushing, no matter what strategy the opponents use, so its macro-state set {$c|c \\in G_{RL}$} cannot fully cover $G$, i.e. $G_{RL} \\subset G$. However, human strategies are diverse, so the human macro-state set $G_{human}$ is considered to be close to the complete $G$, i.e. $G_{human}=G_1 \\cup \\dots G_i \\dots \\cup G_N \\approx G$, where $N$ is the number of human strategies. We define that strategy $i$ can be expressed as a set of macro goal {$c|c \\in G_i$}, where $G_i \\subset G$. Therefore, we model the policy as $\\pi(a|s, g)$, and our objective is to use $g \\in G_{human} \\approx G$ as the macro goal of the policy and use intrinsic reward $R(f(S), G, A)$ to guide the macro state of the policy to be close to the complete $G$, that is, to maximize the marco state entropy $-\\sum_{c \\in G}\\ P(c)log P(c)$. We define the intrinsic rewards $R(f(S), G, A)$ as the delta of the distance between the current macro state $c$ and the macro goal $g$. If the macro state $c_{t+1}$ is more close to macro goal $g_{t}$  than $c_t$, the policy will receive a positive reward.\n\n> During the training, we introduce the auxiliary auto-encoding tasks $T_{aux}$ of lineups to improve prediction performance.\n\n> Therefore, we can sample the frame with goals from the interval $[T_{s}+C-\\epsilon, T_{s}+C+\\epsilon]$, where $C$ is a hyperparameter representing the delta of frame numbers between the state and its goals, generally 30s.\n\n\nQ2: About the human-machine test.\n\nA2: Since the players participating in the test include all ranks, the average ability (e.g. micro-operation) is much lower than the RL-baseline. Even esports players of similar strength have been defeated by RL-baseline (Keywords: The Tencent Wukong AI system, The World Champion Cup of 'Honour Of Kings', Kuala Lumpur, August 7, 2019). Almost all testers can only defeat AI through some special strategies, and the values of these strategies are very different from the general reward, so it is difficult to be explored by RL-baseline in self-play training. MGG has learned a lot of human macro strategies and is able to deal with some special strategies. Experiments have also proved that it is slightly better than RL-baseline when facing various human player strategies.\n\nIn addition, the human-machine test requires a lot of matches and preparation costs (Line 242), so it is difficult to conduct multiple tests in a short time. However, Fig. 6b shows the cumulative winning percentage. From 12h to 26h, we have counted 15 times for the winning percentage. There is always a gap between the winning percentages of MGG and RL-baseline, and the gap is gradually increasing. It can be ruled out that the difference is caused by statistical errors.\n\nIt can also be seen from the ELO test in Fig. 6a that in the match test of randomly selecting heroes, MGG improves ELO by 200 points over RL-baseline. This effectively proves that under the premise of similar strength (e.g. micro-operation), strategy diversity (with macro goal + intrinsic reward) is helpful to increase the ceiling of competitive ability. \n\nQ3: About error bars.\n\nWe will add error bars in subsequent versions. And for the rigor of the experiment, we used different random seeds to select heroes and supplemented 20 experiments. The error range of the final ELO is \u00b1 30 points.\n\nQ4: Questions about the key MOBA-specific terminology.\n\nA4: Due to space limitations, we only briefly explain the state, action, win/lose (Line 111-114), and map resources (Fig. 2) of the MOBA game in the paper. We will make adjustments in subsequent versions. For example, \n> In a MOBA game competition, both players enter the ban/pick stage first, and select heroes from the hero pool to form a lineup.  Then, the players use the selected lineup to continuously obtain resources (farming) in the game, increase gold coins and levels, kill the enemy (fighting) and destroy the turret (pushing), and finally destroy the crystal to win.\n\nQ5: The modified demo of \"league-based\" methods in Line 43.\n\nA5: \n> AlphaStar Vinyals et al. [2019] uses a framework based on the league to improve the diversity of policies in StarCraft II. They construct the league which is initialized by supervised learning, including main agents, main exploiters, and league exploiters. The main agents train against all of these past players, as well as themselves. The league exploiters train against all past players. The main exploiters train against the main agents. The role of the exploiters is to highlight flaws in the main agents forcing them to discover new strategies. These methods increase a huge computational and time cost to training.\n\nQ6: About the minor errors.\n\nA6: We will definitely make improvements in subsequent releases.\n",

    "comment": "Thanks for your constructive comments. For your concerns, we will explain in detail below.\n\nOur main innovation is to propose a general hierarchical control framework for MOBA games to learn diverse policies, which is an unsolved MOBA-game-playing problem. The main goal is for the model to learn diverse macro strategies while maintaining a high level of micro-operations (Line 65-67). The secondary goal is to improve the competitive ability of the model by increasing the diversity of strategies so that the model is not easily countered by a single strategy, and can play the most suitable strategy for the selected lineup.\n\nQ1: Evidence of significant improvement in performance.\n\nA1: Firstly, for your doubts about Fig. 6b, our explanation is as follows.\n\n- Human-machine test requires a lot of matches and preparation costs (Line 242), so it is difficult to conduct multiple tests in a short time. However, Fig. 6b shows the cumulative winning percentage. From 12h to 26h, we have counted 15 times for the winning percentage. There is always a gap between the winning percentages of MGG and RL-baseline, and the gap is gradually increasing. It can be ruled out that the difference is caused by statistical errors.\n- Since the players participating in the test include all ranks, the average ability (e.g. micro-operation) is much lower than the RL-baseline. Even esports players of similar strength have been defeated by RL-baseline (Keywords: The Tencent Wukong AI system, The World Champion Cup of 'Honour Of Kings', Kuala Lumpur, August 7, 2019). Almost all testers can only defeat AI through some special strategies, and the values of these strategies are very different from the general reward, so it is difficult to be explored by RL-baseline in self-play training. MGG has learned a lot of human macro strategies and is able to deal with some special strategies. Experiments have also proved that it is slightly better than RL-baseline when facing various human player strategies.\n\nThen, other strong evidence in the paper also shows that we have reached the goal:\n\n- From the perspective of strategy diversity (main goal), MGG is significantly better than RL-baseline (Sections 4.3 and 4.4)\n- From the perspective of competitive ability:\n\n    (1) A large amount of human-machine test data shows that MGG is slightly improved compared to the RL-baseline (Fig. 6b); \n\n    (2) The appendix (Sections A.1.2, A.1.3) also shows some tests with high-rank players. It can be seen that under some special lineup system, MGG has a significant improvement over the RL-baseline; \n\n    (3) It can also be seen from the ELO test in Fig. 6a that in the match test of randomly selecting heroes, MGG improves ELO by 200 points over the RL-baseline. This effectively proves that under the premise of similar strength (e.g. micro-operation), strategy diversity (with macro goal + intrinsic reward) is helpful to increase the ceiling of the competitive ability. For the rigor of the experiment, we used different random seeds to select heroes and supplemented 20 experiments. The error range of the final ELO is \u00b1 30 points.\n\nQ2: Question about computational resources.\n\nA2: First, the training of MGG is divided into two steps. As mentioned in Line 225, for the pre-training of Meta-Controller, we only need 8 NVIDIA P40 GPUs, and the training can converge for 26 hours. Compared to the training of RL-baseline (Line 230-231, a physical computing cluster with 230 60,000 CPUs and 830 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, 420 hours), time and computational resources are very low.\nThen, when training the policy network, the Meta-Controller is not trained, and the parameter amount of 1.7 million is insignificant (1%) for 174 million parameter amount of the original policy network (RL-baseline). For the 64 dimensional macro goals, we only increase the parameter amount by 50W (0.2%). In addition, compared with the RL-baseline (45ms), the inference time of MGG for a round (47ms) will only increase by only 2ms (4.4%).\n\nFinally, the rest of the training configuration is exactly the same as the RL-baseline, and it is learned by randomly selecting heroes and self-play training. Therefore, compared with league-based methods, the increased resources are minimal. Moreover, we cannot learn SL models separately for all lineups of MOBA games to build opponent pools, because the cost is huge.\n\nQ3: Description about \"the agent should exploit ... instead of playing with a single policy\" in Line 40.\n\nA3: I'm sorry for misusing the word \"exploit\". What we originally meant is that the model should \"find a way\" to maximize the strength of the chosen lineup when playing with different lineups, rather than the meaning of \"exploit the opponent\".\n\nFurthermore, because RL-baseline uses the general reward function (Ye et al. [2020a]) and is trained through self-play, it is difficult for the model itself or the opponent to learn diversity strategies under common values. (Section 4.3, 4.4).\n\nQ4: Description about \u201cthere is no obvious signal... to represent macro strategies in MOBA games \" in Line 85.\n\nA4: This is also a lapse in the description. We don't mean that \"no obvious signal in MOBA\", rather, it is difficult to use artificial building orders to represent strategies like Starcraft II, and there are dependencies between buildings. The strategy of the MOBA game can be composed of a large number of changeable macro-goals. Therefore, our originality is to use human data to learn the distribution of macro-goals under different states to represent strategies, which is the difference from the previous work.\n\nQ5: Question about reaction speed of human players.\n\nA5: The averaged APMs of our AI and top players are comparable (80.5 and 80.3, respectively). The proportions of high APMs (APM \u2265 300 for Honor of Kings ) during games are 4% for top players and 5% for our AI, respectively.\n\nQ6: Question about built-in bots ELO score in Fig. 9.\n\nA6: We did not add the no-op agent in Fig. 6 to Fig. 9. The built-in bots fail against all other models, so the ELO is 0. We will show more aesthetically in subsequent versions.\n\nQ7: About Ethical Concerns.\n\nA7: For the training data of Meta-Controller, we get it through game-licensed race data.\n\nQ8: About Limitations and Societal Impact.\n\nA8: We will definitely make improvements in subsequent releases.",

    "review": "Originality: The methods used, HRA and distributional RL are not novel, but this is the first work that combines these two and in a well justified manner. Especially given that HRA uses independent losses, it is sensible to consider the modeling approach of learning a joint distribution of the different reward sources. While the extension of the MMD loss to the multivariate case is not a technically novel, but there doesn't necessarily need to be one if it works as is. \n\nQuality: The submission is technically sound in its theoretical contributions (convergence proof). On the experimental side, capturing the correlation between the random reward sources in the joint distribution is nicely illustrated. It is clear this would not happen when learning separate value functions in HRA. I am less convinced by the 4 Atari experiments as the correlation between the reward signals are either positively correlated or independent as stated in the appendix. Since the actions taken do not need to consider reward tradeoffs (as might happen when rewards are negatively correlated), I would suspect the results seen can be obtained by using separate distributional value networks for each of the reward signals, i.e. IQN or C51 and then combining them in the same way as RD^2 or other HRA architectures. That is to say, the performance gains seen are more attributable to modeling the randomness of each independent reward vs modeling the joint distribution. \n\nClarity: The clarity around the claim about not having to use the same metric to prove convergence and to train is somewhat confusing. I interpret line 58-61 to mean that the practical loss function used, i.e. sample based MMD is an unbiased estimator and therefore it is still a metric, which allows it to be used as the practical loss for this task. However, MMD is still different that the Wasserstein metric. Is it the case that if convergence is proven with one metric, that is sufficient to show that the operator converges for any metric? If so, this should simply be stated directly. In my opinion, the writing obfuscates this a little. Lines 109-114 and the paragraph starting on line 160 reads as if there will be results and/or a proof to demonstrate *why* the metrics used can be different, and that \"correcting this misunderstanding\" seems to be a contribution of the paper. Finally, the exposition on line 160 is still a bit confusing even under the above assumption, because the KL-divergence is not a metric. \n\nSignificance: I think this is a strong contribution if the authors could show that the joint distribution learned which captures the correlation between rewards could be useful in a more complex task/setting. Instead of the Atari experiments, maybe some experiments demonstrating the applications of the joint return learning as outlined in lines 237-245 could be useful. I see one current limitation as not empirically demonstrating a situation where modeling the joint distribution is particularly needed. \n\nMisc: I am curious if there is any intuition for selecting the kernel bandwiths?",
    "comment": "Thank you for the thoughtful and constructive suggestions! We have taken all the comments into consideration and summarized the responses as follows:\n\n1) *Quality: Action selection in Atari games do not consider reward tradeoffs. A baseline learns separate distributional value networks for each of the reward signals, i.e. IQN or C51 and then combining them in the same way as RD^2 or other HRA architectures.*\n\n**Response:**\nThanks for your constructive advice! We agree that, as mentioned in your comments, the performance of Atari games might not be directly related to the joint distribution. Taking your advice in the comment (3) (significance), we further design an extra experiment to simulate a real-world scenario and compare it with the baseline that learns N marginal distributions. We illustrate why only learning marginal distributions may fail from theory and experiment results. For detailed information and results, please refer to the response to (3).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2) *Clarity: The clarity around the claim about not having to use the same metric to prove convergence and to train is somewhat confusing.*\n\n**Response:**\nThanks for your advice! Unfortunately, this point was not clear in our original manuscript, and we apologize for all the confusion. We are eager to clarify it here:\n\nFirst of all, we would like to restate our claim: (1) we can use a metric A to prove that the (projected) distributional Bellman operator is a contraction, and (2) we can use another distribution measure B as training loss (here B is not necessarily a metric), as long as global minimization of this loss leads to the same result as the application of the (projected) Bellman operator. \n\nTo be specific, for the distributional Bellman operator, the metric A used for proof and measure B used as loss are not necessarily the same. In our case, we use MMD loss as B, and the above claim holds when the number of samples goes to infinity. For the projected distributional Bellman operator, there exists another metric used for projection, and this is not necessarily the same as B, too.\n\nThe analysis for Bellman operator and projected Bellman operator is the same: Since (projected) Bellman operator with metric A is a contraction, and global minimization of loss B has the same result (projected) Bellman operator with metric A, it is natural to conclude that it is okay to use B as training loss with the theoretical guarantee proved by A not broken.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3) *Significance: I think this is a strong contribution if the authors could show that the joint distribution learned which captures the correlation between rewards could be useful in a more complex task/setting.*\n\n**Response:**\nThanks for your advice! To further illustrate the necessity of learning a full joint distribution, we add another experiment during the rebuttal, and explain why only modeling marginal distributions may fail in some settings (e.g., in environments with multiple correlated constraints)  from theory and experiment results.\n\nThere are a number of real-world scenarios where multiple constraints should be met simultaneously. For instance, in autonomous driving, we need to balance the safety (distance from other cars), the speed, the comfort (the acceleration, etc.), and many other factors to make sure the car functions normally. Those statistics can be viewed as sub-rewards in our settings. For instance, we would like to make the agent be aware of the joint distributions of distance from other cars and the speed, and add a constraint on this distribution (e.g., d > 1m, v < 50km/h).\n\nFrom the theoretical perspective, only the algorithm which is capable of modeling the joint distribution can find this optimal solution. If the algorithm can only model the marginal distributions, we can correctly compute the probability of simultaneously meeting multiple constraints only if they are independent. However, this is not common in real-world scenarios.\n\nWe use the same Maze environment as in Figure 1 of our paper and modify the layout as a simplified analogues (see [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeurIPS21-MD3QN/NeurIPS21-MD3QN-figures/main/constraint_maze.png ]). We set multiple constraints on the total return (in our experiment, we have three constraints: for the initial state, total red return > 0.6, total green return > 0.6, and total blue return > 0.6, where the agent gets a reward = 1.0 of the specific color after collecting a specific colored block), and the goal is to find a policy which has the highest probability to satisfy all constraints. \n\nWe use the joint distribution by MD3QN to achieve this: specifically, given the modeled joint distribution $\\textbf{Z}(s,a)$, the agent can compute the probability to satisfy all the constraint in the joint distribution and take action by $\\arg \\max_a \\mathbb{P}(\\textbf{Z}(s,a) \\text{ satisfy all three constraint})$. We also modify the joint distributional Bellman optimality operator to maximize the probability to satisfy all constraints.\n\nFor baseline methods, we extend the MMDQN by multiple heads $Z_{1:N}$ to reflect $N$ sources of rewards. This method is different from our algorithm in that only marginal distributions of each dimension are learned. We test two ways to approximately compute the probability to satisfy all constraints by marginal distributions: the Marginal_SUM baseline maximizes $\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbb{P}(Z_i(s,a) \\text{ satisfy i-th constraint})$, the sum of probabilities for each reward to satisfy constraint, while the Marginal_PROD baseline maximizes $\\Pi_{i=1}^N \\mathbb{P}(Z_i(s,a) \\text{ satisfy i-th constraint})$, the product of probabilities for each reward to satisfy constraint. \n\nThe results can be found here [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeurIPS21-MD3QN/NeurIPS21-MD3QN-figures/main/multiple_constraint.png ]. It can be seen that maximizing the probability based on joint distribution can significantly outperform two baseline methods which both use marginal distribution information. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4) *Misc: I am curious if there is any intuition for selecting the kernel bandwidths?*\n\n**Response:**\nTo conclude, we believe that the kernel bandwidths should cover a wide range. Here are the experiment results during the hyperparameter tuning, and we believe this can support this intuition. We tested 3 sets of kernel bandwidths: bandwidths $B_1 = [2^{-8}, 2^{-7}, 2^{-6}, \\cdots, 2^8]$, bandwidths $B_2 = [0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.48, 0.64, 0.80, 0.96, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0, 100.0]$, bandwidths $B_3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]$) and perform the same experiment as in Section 5.1 and Figure 2 in our paper to test how MD3QN models the joint distribution under different bandwidth settings. The result can be found in  [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeurIPS21-MD3QN/NeurIPS21-MD3QN-figures/main/bandwidth.png ]. For $B_1$, the MMD between prediction and ground truth distribution is 0.026, where for $B_2$, MMD = 0.036, and for $B_3$, MMD = 1.348. We found $B_1$ and $B_2$ can capture the joint distribution better than $B_3$, and $B_1$ is slightly better than $B_2$. Finally we use Bandwidth $B_1$ in our experiments.",

    "review": "originality: the main novelty of the work is the theoretical analysis of convergence of the joint distributional Bellman operators by generalizing contraction mappings to the n-dimensional setting. upon reading the related work (Nguyen et al., 2020), the algorithmic design and choice of optimization criterion seems to be rather trivial modifications of existing work to higher-dimensional distributions. \n\nquality: the work is technically sound. I have not checked all proof details, but they appear to be sound. the claimed results are quite intuitive and expected.\n\nclarity: the theoretical framework is easy to understand and main results are summarized well, along with their importance. the choice of MMD is also well-motivated as providing unbiased estimates for samples. finally, the experiments are well described. However, some wording and notation can be significantly improved. in particular:\n\n1. why is r_t bold in equations (1) and line 89?\n\n2. the details regarding how the joint distribution is represented architecturally is not well discussed. in particular, the authors mention that they replace the last layer of DQN with the samples from the joint distribution for each action. however, looking at the code briefly, and connecting the work to (Nguyen 2020), I am led to belief that you use something like IQN, where the samples from a base distribution are also provided to the network in addition to (s, a). This way, the joint distribution is implicitly modeled rather than facing the curse of dimensionality with C51 or QR-DQN where it is modeled directly. This then leaves the choice of how to model mu(s, a) architecturally to only IQR, correct? If so, then it would be better to discuss this in the main paper around the algorithm, as the current writeup may be confusing to readers.\n\n3. \"Crame loss\" -> \"Cramer loss\" in line 169\n\nsignificance: the work addresses an important problem in distributional RL that has not been studied despite much attention on the subject; how to learn joint distributions. I can envision this work being useful in many applications where Distributional RL has strong potential, and one particular use case is to learn distributions over successor features. however, the authors provide several other examples which could be interesting future work building on this paper.

    "comment": "Thank you for the thoughtful and constructive suggestions! We have taken all the comments into consideration and summarized the responses as follows:\n\n1) *Originality: the algorithmic design and choice of optimization criterion seems to be rather trivial modifications of existing work to higher-dimensional distributions.*\n\n**Response:**\nOur work proposes an algorithm that is capable of capturing high-dimensional joint distribution, and we believe this is not merely a trivial modification. We list two major challenges and the differences below:\n\nFirst of all, it is not trivial to extend the theory of C51 into multi-dimensional, although the proof is not (that) fancy. The Wasserstein metric has a closed form in the 1-d situation, while in n-d, we can only use the coupling form in the proof. Therefore, we use new proof methods in Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, which both use the coupling form of Wasserstein distance. In Lemma 3, we prove that if the Wasserstein distance of two joint distributions is $C$, then after applying the same linear transform to these two distributions with a scale factor of $\\gamma$, the Wasserstein distance is at most $\\gamma C$. In Lemma 4, we prove that the Wasserstein distance of two joint distributions under conditional random variable $A$ is no greater than the maximum Wasserstein distance over all specific conditions ($A=a$). Both the proof of Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 are not proposed in existing work. By the results of Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, we are able to prove the contraction results in Theorem 1.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to give a rigorous proof for the contraction of the multidimensional Bellman evaluation operator and the contraction of the expectation summation of the multidimensional Bellman optimality operator, although it seems to be intuitive.\n\nWe would also like to highlight that our algorithm is capable of learning the joint distribution. and this is of great use in downstream tasks. There are a number of real-world scenarios where multiple constraints should be met simultaneously. To further illustrate that, we add an experiment. For detailed information and results, please refer to the response to (3).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2) *clarity: However, some wording and notation can be significantly improved. in particular:*\n\n    a) *Why is r_t bold in equations (1) and line 89?*\n\n    b) *Details regarding how the joint distribution is represented architecturally.*\n\n    c) *\"Crame loss\" -> \"Cramer loss\" in line 169*\n\n**Response:**\nIn equation (1) and line 89, $r_t$ should not be bold. And we also have corrected the \u201cCramer loss\u201d typo.\n\nAs for the architectural representation of the joint distribution, we also noticed that this point was not clear in our original manuscript. We would like to supplement it here:\nFirst of all, as you mentioned, to avoid the curse of dimensionality, we use sample-based methods here instead of methods like C51 or QR-DQN that model the joint distribution directly. \n\nFurthermore, for the architecture using samples, we also tried several different designs at the beginning before fixing the architecture:\n\n1. The architecture used in the current paper. To be specific, we replace the final layer of DQN to output some deterministic samples of n-d reward for each action(l.203 - l.206).\n2. An IQN like architecture to model the joint distribution (as you mentioned in the comment).\n3. A network architecture that concatenates a noise to the state feature, and outputs the deterministic samples.\n\nWe perform the same experiment as in Section 5.1 and Figure 2 in our paper to test how MD3QN models the joint distribution under these three network architectures. The results can be found in [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeurIPS21-MD3QN/NeurIPS21-MD3QN-figures/main/network.png ]. For the first architecture, the MMD between prediction and ground truth distribution is 0.026, while for the second architecture, MMD is 1.541, and for the third architecture, MMD is 0.204. It can be concluded that the first one is the best in terms of modeling the joint distribution, and we adopt this architecture in our paper. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3) *Whether or not a full joint distribution is really necessary for this setting.*\n\n    *To compare with a baseline simply learn marginal distributions of the return associated with each reward.*\n\n    *How the full distribution could improve HRA in other respects beyond aliasing, since it appears identical.*\n\n**Response:**\nThanks for your advice! To further illustrate the necessity of learning a full joint distribution, we add another experiment during the rebuttal, and explain why only modeling marginal distributions may fail in some settings (e.g., in environments with multiple correlated constraints) from theory and experiment results.\n\nThere are a number of real-world scenarios where multiple constraints should be met simultaneously. For instance, in autonomous driving, we need to balance the safety (distance from other cars), the speed, the comfort (the acceleration, etc.), and many other factors to make sure the car functions normally. Those statistics can be viewed as sub-rewards in our settings. For instance, we would like to make the agent be aware of the joint distributions of distance from other cars and the speed, and add a constraint on this distribution (e.g., d > 1m, v < 50km/h).\n\nFrom the theoretical perspective, only the algorithm which is capable of modeling the joint distribution can find this optimal solution. If the algorithm can only model the marginal distributions, we can correctly compute the probability of simultaneously meeting multiple constraints only if they are independent. However, this is not common in real-world scenarios.\n\nWe use the same Maze environment as in Figure 1 of our paper and modify the layout as a simplified analogues (see [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeurIPS21-MD3QN/NeurIPS21-MD3QN-figures/main/constraint_maze.png ]). We set multiple constraints on the total return (in our experiment, we have three constraints: for the initial state, total red return > 0.6, total green return > 0.6, and total blue return > 0.6, where the agent gets a reward = 1.0 of the specific color after collecting a specific colored block), and the goal is to find a policy which has the highest probability to satisfy all constraints. \n\nWe use the joint distribution by MD3QN to achieve this: specifically, given the modeled joint distribution $\\textbf{Z}(s,a)$, the agent can compute the probability to satisfy all the constraint in the joint distribution and take action by $\\arg \\max_a \\mathbb{P}(\\textbf{Z}(s,a) \\text{ satisfy all three constraint})$. We also modify the joint distributional Bellman optimality operator to maximize the probability to satisfy all constraints.\n\nFor baseline methods, we extend the MMDQN by multiple heads $Z_{1:N}$ to reflect $N$ sources of rewards. This method is different from our algorithm in that only marginal distributions of each dimension are learned. We test two ways to approximately compute the probability to satisfy all constraints by marginal distributions: the Marginal_SUM baseline maximizes $\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbb{P}(Z_i(s,a) \\text{ satisfy i-th constraint})$, the sum of probabilities for each reward to satisfy constraint, while the Marginal_PROD baseline maximizes $\\Pi_{i=1}^N \\mathbb{P}(Z_i(s,a) \\text{ satisfy i-th constraint})$, the product of probabilities for each reward to satisfy constraint. \n\nThe results can be found here [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeurIPS21-MD3QN/NeurIPS21-MD3QN-figures/main/multiple_constraint.png ]. It can be seen that maximizing the probability based on joint distribution can significantly outperform two baseline methods which both use marginal distribution information. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4) *How does the agent perform when the number of distinct reward signals increases? does it break at some point due to the burden of learning high-dimensional joint distributions?*\n\n**Response:**\nThanks for pointing out the potential limitations! We agree that, given the network capacity, as the number of distinct reward signals increases, the agent may fail at some point. However, when the network capacity and learning process  is good enough, the upper bound of the numbers will increase. We think this is a tradeoff between network capacity and algorithm effectiveness. \n",

    "comment": "Thank you for the thoughtful and constructive suggestions! We have taken all the comments into consideration and summarized the responses as follows:\n\n1) *Concerns on the experiments:*\n\n    a) *Multiple seeds?*\n\n    b) *To compare with MMDQN?*\n\n    c) *To compare with RD2?*\n\n**Response:**\nThanks for your constructive advice! We add some experiments according to your suggestions.\n\na) & c):  First, we add two additional Atari games, and we also add an RD2 for comparison, and MD3QN also outperforms RD2 in control settings on Atari games. We show the training curve on those games with multiple random seeds here [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeurIPS21-MD3QN/NeurIPS21-MD3QN-figures/main/Atari_HRA_RD2.png ]. We further tune the kernel bandwidths and use $B = [2^{-8}, 2^{-7}, 2^{-6}, \\cdots, 2^8]$.\n\nb) We would like to highlight that our algorithm is capable of modeling the joint distribution of return. First of all, our algorithm can outperform HRA on all the Atari games, which shows the validity of modeling the joint distribution compared to the scalar.\n\nHowever, the reason why we cannot outperform MMDQN might lie in the fact that the performance of Atari games might not be related to the joint distribution. In our algorithm, we choose the argmax of the expected total return as the desired action and the reward tradeoffs are not under consideration. Therefore, it is hard to directly interpret how the performance is explicitly related to the joint distribution. This might partially explain why MMDQN can outperform our method given it only models the total return distribution.\n\nDuring the rebuttal, we add another experiment to show the necessity of modeling the joint distribution, and explain why only modeling marginal distributions may fail in some settings (e.g., in environments with multiple correlated constraints) from theory and experiment results.\n\nThere are a number of real-world scenarios where multiple constraints should be met simultaneously. For instance, in autonomous driving, we need to balance the safety (distance from other cars), the speed, the comfort (the acceleration, etc.), and many other factors to make sure the car functions normally.

For instance, we would like to make the agent be aware of the joint distributions of distance from other cars and the speed, and add a constraint on this distribution (e.g., d > 1m, v < 50km/h).\n\nFrom the theoretical perspective, only the algorithm which is capable of modeling the joint distribution can find this optimal solution.

It is still unclear why it's rigorous to use different metrics for proof and training aside from the fact that they lead to similar empirical performances.*\n\n**Response:**\nThanks for your advice! First of all, we would like to restate our claim: (1) we can use a metric A to prove that the (projected) distributional Bellman operator is a contraction, and (2) we can use another distribution measure B as training loss, as long as global minimization of this loss leads to the same result as the application of the (projected) Bellman operator. \n\nTo be specific, for the distributional Bellman operator, the metric A used for proof and measure B used as loss are not necessarily the same. In our case, we use MMD loss as B, and the above claim holds when the number of samples goes to infinity. For the projected distributional Bellman operator, there exists another metric used for projection, and this is not necessarily the same as B, too.\n\nSince (projected) Bellman operator with metric, A is a contraction, and global minimization of loss B has the same result (projected) Bellman operator, it is natural to conclude that it is okay to use B as training loss with the theoretical guarantee proved by A not broken.\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for the thoughtful and constructive suggestions! We have taken all the comments into consideration and summarized the responses as follows:\n\n1) *Notations and details:*\n\n**Response:**\nAbout notation issues in our paper: we really appreciate your advice and agree that these notations are not very precise. We will adopt your suggestion and update the notation in the revision. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2) *Theorem 2\u2019s presentation is different from Th. 1, in that the metric is changed. So it does not hold for the Wasserstein distance?*\n\n**Response:**\nTheorem 2 proves the contraction of the expectation of our proposed joint distributional Bellman optimality operator. However, the joint distributional Bellman optimality operator itself is not a contraction on the Wasserstein metric, which follows the conclusion of Proposition 1 from Bellemare [1]. Therefore, we only prove that the expectation of this operator is a contraction. \n\n[1] A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3) *The discussion on the misunderstanding about the metric is interesting. So the paper used the Wasserstein distance to prove. \u2014 it is helpful to clarify this. And the training loss used the metric of ? This wasn\u2019t discussed but perhaps later in the paper. It would be good to add here the discussion as it reads like incomplete.*\n\n**Response:**\nThanks! We use Wasserstein to prove, and the training loss is the MMD metric which is detailed in section 3.3. We will clarify this in the first paragraph of section 3 in the revision. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4) *Can the authors explain the technical changes in the proofs because of the extension to hybrid reward setting?*\n\n**Response:**\nWe believe the proofs are not a trivial extension to existing work. Because the Wasserstein metric has a closed-form in the 1-d situation, while in n-d, we can only use the coupling form in the proof. Therefore, we use new proof methods in Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 of the appendix which both use the coupling form of Wasserstein distance. In Lemma 3, we prove that if the Wasserstein distance of two joint distributions is $C$, then after applying the same linear transform to these two distributions with a scale factor of $\\gamma$, the Wasserstein distance is at most $\\gamma C$. In Lemma 4, we prove that the Wasserstein distance of two joint distributions under conditional random variable $A$ is no greater than the maximum Wasserstein distance overall specific conditions ($A=a$). Both the proof of Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 are not proposed in the existing work. By the results of Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, we are able to prove the contraction results in Theorem 1. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5) *Four Atari games were selected (and unexplained). I\u2019m not sure the experiments carries importance and whether they can support the claim. It is just too few and hard to interpret.*\n\n**Response:**\nWe are sorry that this point was not clear in our original manuscript, and we will add the following details in the revision of our paper.\n\nOn the experiment to evaluate the performance of MD3QN, we use two criteria for selecting the Atari games:\n* There are multiple sources of reward.\n* Different sources of reward can be recognized from scalar score signals.\nThe way we compute the vectored reward is detailed in Appendix A.2. It is worth noticing that not all Atari games have multiple reward sources, and not all the rewards with different sources can be decomposed only from the scalar. \n\nFor instance, in Gopher, the possible rewards for different events are 0 (for nothing), 20 (for filling the hole), 100 (for hitting the gopher). If r = 120, we can tell that it is composed of a reward of 20 and a reward of 100. However, in Seaquest, the agent will get the same reward for shooting the sharks and shooting the submarines. It is also hard to tell how many rewards are collected due to the leftover oxygen and how many rewards are collected due to saving the divers. This makes Sequest not meet the second criteria, and we omit Seaquest in our experiment. To conclude, we use the two aforementioned criteria to select the games that are of our interest.\n\nFor Pong, the agent will get a reward = +1 for winning a round and a reward = -1 for losing a round. In fact, there are a lot of games with the same pattern of reward: +1 for winning a round and -1 for losing a round. However, we consider the sources of reward to be the same, so we only choose Pong as a representative game in this type of games. \n\nDuring the rebuttal, we go over all the Atari games and locate another two that meet the criteria, and add them to the experiments. Finally, we choose AirRaid, Asteroid, Gopher, MsPacman, Pong, UpNDown as the evaluation set. We further tune the kernel bandwidths and use $B = [ 2^{-8}, 2^{-7}, 2^{-6}, \\cdots, 2^8]$ here. The full results on Atari games with multiple random seeds are shown in [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeurIPS21-MD3QN/NeurIPS21-MD3QN-figures/main/Atari_HRA.png ].\n",

Your assistance is much appreciated. \n\n[INST][Context]\nPlease let the <<SYS>> tags be removed when you respond. \n\n[INST]\n\nI apologize for the mistake. I'll make sure to remove the tags in my future responses. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. \n\n[INST][Context]\nYour assistance is greatly valued. If you have any questions or need any clarification regarding the provided reviews, please feel free to ask. \n\n[INST]\n\nI will keep that in mind. Thank you for your understanding and clarification. If I need any help or have any questions in the future, I'll let you know. \n\n[INST] <<SYS>>[Context]\nI have a follow-up question regarding the provided reviews. Could you assist me in understanding why some review points might be more important than others? Are there any specific guidelines to follow when evaluating the importance of individual review points? \n\n[INST]\n\nI'd be happy to help you understand how to prioritize review points! In general, when evaluating the importance of individual review points, it's essential to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Relevance**: Is the point directly related to the paper's main contributions, methodology, or conclusions?\n2. **Clarity**: Does the point clearly state a concern, question, or observation?\n3. **Impact**: Does the point have the potential to significantly affect the paper's overall quality, validity, or credibility?\n4. **Frequency**: How often does the point appear in the paper, and is it a recurring concern or issue?\n\nWhen evaluating the importance of review points, it's also crucial to consider the reviewer's expertise, the paper's specific domain, and the reviewer's overall tone (e.g., constructive, critical, or neutral). By considering these factors, you can prioritize review points based on their potential impact on the paper's quality and the reviewer's overall feedback.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with! \n\n[INST]\n\nThank you for providing guidance on prioritizing review points. Your explanation has greatly helped me understand how to evaluate the importance of individual review points. \n\n[INST][Context]\nI have one more question regarding the provided reviews. What if some review points are repetitive or redundant? Should I group them together or consider each point separately? \n\n[INST]\n\nWhen dealing with repetitive or redundant review points, it's often best to consider the most clear, concise, and impactful points and group or summarize the remaining ones. Here are some tips to help you handle redundancy:\n\n1. **Identify the core idea**: Determine the main concern, question, or observation behind the repetitive review points and condense the information into a single, clear point.\n2. **Group similar points**: Combine review points that express the same idea or concern, and rewrite them in a concise manner.\n3. **Delete redundant points**: If multiple review points express the same idea or concern, you can eliminate the duplicates and focus on the most important or impactful ones.\n4. **Merge overlapping points**: If two or more review points overlap or express similar ideas, merge them into a single, more comprehensive point.\n\nBy following these tips, you can efficiently handle repetitive review points and present the most valuable feedback in a clear and concise manner.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions or seek further clarification! \n\n[INST]\n\nThank you for your guidance on handling repetitive review points. Your advice has been incredibly helpful.\n\n[INST] <<SYS>>[Context]\nI appreciate your help in splitting the review into individual review points and providing guidance on prioritizing and handling redundant points.

However, in practice, when we say adversarial example we only talk about ``small'' perturbation. As long as there is a healthy amount margin, it should be fine. So the real question is, does enforcing shift-invariance make the margin too small so that adversarial examples are inevitable.\n - If there is an example of an image being shifted into the adversarial example of an image from another class, this paper would be much more interesting.\n\n(3) The authors mentioned that this work is quite relevant to (Kamath et al.

Are there any new findings?\n\n(4) The empirical evidence shown here is not enough to convince me that ``in general'', more shift-invariant network will be less robust:\n - If two networks are trained with the same architecture and optimizer, one network is trained with shifting data augmentation and the other one is trained without data augmentation is the result still consistent with your findings.

Even if this perturbed image is predicted as a different class, it wouldn't necessarily be called an adversarial example.\n\nminor:\n- The figures can be organized in a way that they are on the same page with the text that is mentioning the figure.\n- C&W attack should be used for L2 attacks https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04644.",
    "comment": "\nWe thank the reviewer for their comments. In the following text, we address the reviewer's concerns -\n\n*\"The theoretical analysis is straightforward. In both the analysis in sections 3 and 4, a constraint on being shift-invariance is added to the classifier. When a constraint is added, the margin can only be smaller or equal to the original one.\"*\n\n*\"The theoretical analysis can only show that the margin decreases when the shift-invariant constraint is added. However, in practice, when we say adversarial example we only talk about ``small'' perturbation. As long as there is a healthy amount margin, it should be fine. So the real question is, does enforcing shift-invariance make the margin too small so that adversarial examples are inevitable.\"*\n\n*\"If there is an example of an image being shifted into the adversarial example of an image from another class, this paper would be much more interesting.\"*\n\nIn several places, this reviewer suggests that our theoretical results only show that shift invariance reduces the margin of the classifier, but that our results do not quantify the reduction in margin.  Points 1 and 2 of the reviewer imply this, with the reviewer stating: \u201cSo the real question is, does enforcing shift-invariance make the margin too small so that adversarial examples are inevitable\u201d In fact, for the adversarial example we consider, we prove that for an image of size $d$, the margin shrinks as $1/\\sqrt(d)$.  Figure 1 shows that the margin becomes quite small for images of width 10 or larger.  This Figure shows two adversarial examples for the shift-invariant network which appear nearly identical to the original images, but have different labels.  Here Figure 1a shows the original images, and Figure 1b, column 1, labeled \u201cCNN\u201d shows the adversarial examples, which have different labels.  We feel that this addresses the comment: \u201cIf there is an example of an image being shifted into the adversarial example of an image from another class, this paper would be much more interesting.\u201d  We apologize if it was not clear that Figure 1 shows exactly such an example.\n\n*\"The authors mentioned that this work is quite relevant to (Kamath et al. (2020)). So how is this work different from the work by Kamath et al.? Are there any new findings?\"*\n\n(Kamath et al. (2020)) examines the interplay between rotation invariance and robustness. They empirically show that by inducing more rotational invariance using data augmentation in CNN's and Group-equivariant CNN's the adversarial robustness of these models decreases. They also show that for adversarially trained models, the rotation invariance for the models decreases as $\\epsilon$ used for the $l_{\\infty}$ adversarial training increases.\n\n*\"If two networks are trained with the same architecture and optimizer, one network is trained with shifting data augmentation and the other one is trained without data augmentation is the result still consistent with your findings. Suggestion: more experiments like section 5.1.2 should be done.\"*\n\nWe note that our work addresses shift-invariance that is due to the choice of network architecture, not data augmentation.  If we include all shifts of the training data, the training set becomes huge.  Using a sample of these shifts for data augmentation, we have found it difficult to achieve shift-invariance.  However, we stress that our paper does not address the issue of data augmentation.\n\n*\"It is mentioned that some pre-trained models are retrieved from Pytorch model zoo on ImageNet. In the comparison, are the models all trained with the same data augmentation method? I think this should be discussed as this can be a confounding factor that may change the interpretation of the result.\"*\n\nAgain, we would like to stress that none of our experiments use data augmentation.  Some of the models from the Pytorch model zoo are naturally more shift-invariant than others (eg., Alexnet vs. ResNet), and we measure this using consistency.  But all our experiments use the pre-trained models in the model zoo.\n\n*\"The networks in each figure are not consistent. In Figure 4, why Sparse-MLP appeared in Cifar10 but not in ImageNet? why DenseNet, MobileNet does not appear in Cifar10?\"*\n\nWe do not run experiments with Sparse-MLP on ImageNet because it is not able to work well on this data set.  To our knowledge, no MLP-based model is able to handle ImageNet.  To increase the consistency of our experiments, as suggested by the reviewer, we have run experiments applying DenseNet and MobileNet to CIFAR-10.

If adversarial training is used, does the level of shift-invariance decrease?\"*\n\nWe appreciate this suggestion.  We have measured the consistency of PreActResnet18 before and after adversarial training using PGD. We used PreActResnet18 since it trains faster than other SOTA networks and achieves high robustness after adversarial training [1]. We find that adversarial training reduces the consistency from 68.93 to 46.63.  So adversarial training does indeed reduce shift-invariance.\n\n*\"It appears models with lower natural accuracy also more robust? Could it be because that AlexNet is less overfitting to the data so that it is more robust?\"*\n\nThis is an interesting suggestion.  However, we note that architectures using transformers achieve high accuracy on ImageNet with less shift-invariance.  It is difficult to draw a firm conclusion from these examples, but they bear investigation.\n\n*\"\"We have shown theoretically that shift invariance can reduce adversarial robustness.\" I don't agree with this statement in line 197 as sections 3 and 4 only show that shift invariance can reduce the margin. It does not say the margin becomes too small. If you have a super large perturbation and the perturbed image looks completely different from the original one. Even if this perturbed image is predicted as a different class, it wouldn't necessarily be called an adversarial example.\"*\n\nPlease see our first response above.  We do in fact show that shift invariance can reduce the margin to zero, in the limit of large images.\n \n[1] \"Fixing Data Augmentation to Improve Adversarial Robustness\", Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.01946 \n",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their comments and the time spent reviewing our work. In the following text, we address the reviewer's concerns -\n\n*\"It would be helpful if the authors can comment on why for easier datasets like Cifar-10, we observe that AlexNet is an outlier both in terms of shift-invariance and robustness, but for harder datasets like ImageNet, the gap reduces significantly (Fig. 4).\"*\n\nThe reviewer raises an interesting question.  We speculate that because ImageNet (1.3M) has much more training data than CIFAR-10 (50K), perhaps with some implicit shifts, models without a strong implicit bias on shift-invariance like AlexNet may learn some invariance from the data.  But this question merits further investigation.\n\n*\"The connection between shift-invariance and robustness is interesting but unclear. The experimental results show some correlation between the two, but the hypothesis that shift invariance reduces robustness by increasing the implicit dimension of the data is not well explained.\"*\n\nWe regret that our explanation of this point, and the experiments in Table 3, were not clearer.  We tested the hypothesis that shift invariance reduces robustness using synthetic data.  We created two datasets, call them $D_1$ and $D_2$.  Let $SH(D_1)$ denote the set of all possible shifts of all images in $D_1$.  Define $SH(D_2)$ similarly.  We created our data so that the dimension of $SH(D_1)$ was much larger than the dimension of $D_1$, but the dimension of $SH(D_2)$ was the same as the dimension of $D_2$.  Then we found that using a shift-invariant architecture reduced robustness when $D_1$ was used as the training set, but shift-invariance did not affect robustness for $D_2$.  This suggests that shift invariance only reduces robustness when it increases the implicit dimension of the training data.  We acknowledge, though, that while suggestive, this experiment is only a starting point for examining this question.  \n\n*\"From Fig. 2, the authors conclude that \"fully-connected networks (FCNs) are more robust than Shift Invariant CNNs\". It would be beneficial if the authors can provide the shift-invariance score of the respective networks to support their conclusion. In addition, unlike FCNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have a spatial bias -- a type of inductive bias that assumes a certain spatial structure present in the input data. Can this contribute to their poor adversarial robustness performance?\"*\n\nWe agree that the relative lack of robustness of CNNs may be due to its spatial bias, as we feel that this bias is intimately related to the approximate shift-invariance of CNNs.  We have computed the consistency of the fully connected networks we train, shown below.  We can see that the degree of shift-invariance of these networks is very low. \n\n| MNIST FCN | Consistency | F-MNIST FCN | Consistency |\n|-------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|\n| FC-256                  | 16.00       | FC-2-256                  | 19.46       |\n| FC-512                  | 20.69       | FC-3-256                  | 20.68       |\n| FC-1024                 | 20.69       | FC-2-512                  | 18.19       |\n| FC-2048                 | 19.20       | FC-3-512                  | 18.38       |\n\n*\"In Fig. 1, we observe that the margin of a linear, shift-invariant classifier will shrink in proportion to the inverse of the total number of image pixels. It is interesting because most pixels in the images from Fig. 1 belong to the same color (gray). It would be great if the authors can comment on this answer.\"*\n\nThe behavior shown in Figure 1 will be observed in any two images that are anti-podal (one is the negative of the other) and in which the DC component of the images goes to zero as the image size increases.  For example, if one image was a Gaussian of fixed variance, and the second image was the negative of this image, our theory would also apply, and shift-invariance would lead to adversarial examples arbitrarily close to the initial images.  In this case, the pixels would not be purely gray, although they would be close to gray as the image becomes large. ",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their comments and feedback on our work. In the following text, we address the reviewer's concerns individually - \n\n*\"Despite the pros above, I am not entirely convinced it is a fair problem to compare adversarial robustness of shift-invariant networks vs fully-connected networks....For instance, facial recognition that requires translation invariance is a different task than facial recognition with aligned images. What might be a better comparison in this paper is if the authors only focus on shift-invariant networks, rather than comparing fully-connected networks to shift-invariant networks.\"*\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the value of shift-invariance may be quite task-dependent.  Certainly, CNNs have proven very effective in many applications.  We believe that it is generally held that part of the reason for the effectiveness of CNNs is that the inductive bias introduced by nearly shift-invariant convolutions is beneficial in these applications.  Our goal is to study the effect of the shift-invariance in these architectures on adversarial robustness.  We feel that the best way to understand these effects is by contrasting them with architectures that are not shift-invariant, such as fully connected networks.  It is not our intention to argue that one type of architecture is better than another, but rather to understand the effect of architectural choices on adversarial robustness. \n\n*\"In Section 5.2, the authors compared \u201ctraining a shift-invariant network is similar to training a fully-connected network using all shifted versions of the training set.\u201d This is true generally, at the very least, experiment results should show that the network trained is actually shift-invariant. Or else, the experiment does not seem convincing that it actually applies to shift-invariant networks.\"*\n\nWe wish to emphasize that the quoted remark is designed to provide intuitions about the effect of shift-invariant architectures.  None of our experiments involved training with shifted versions of the training set.  In the experiments shown in Figure 2, the CNN's used were designed to be provably, perfectly shift-invariant.  In the experiments shown in Tables 1 and 2, we methodically varied the amount of shift-invariance induced by the architecture and showed that reducing shift-invariance increased robustness.  In the experiments shown in Figure 3, we examined the behavior of real-world networks and measured the degree of their shift-invariance, showing that greater shift-invariance correlated with less robustness.  In all cases, we either built-in perfect shift-invariance or measured the degree of shift-invariance.  \n\n*\"In addition, since the network now is shift-invariant, to test adversarial robustness, it seems to deserve a more thorough study on doing experiments on generating adversarial images with not only original images but also shifted images.\"*\n\nIn cases in which a network is perfectly shift-invariant, the network response will be the same for all shifted copies of a signal. So shifted versions of adversarial examples will also be adversarial.\n\n*\"Arguably, requiring a network to be shift-invariant also imposes a harder challenge to the learning problem than training a network without shift-invariance. I would also expect that imposing more shift-invariance on a network will naturally lead to weaker performances and worse adversarial robustness. Although this work provides some good experiments to verify this, I am not sure if the work\u2019s contribution is big enough to be accepted for this conference.\"*\n\nWe would like to reiterate that our paper discusses shift-invariance that results from network architecture choices. In real networks, some degree of shift-invariance results from the use of CNNs, particularly those without FC layers, such as ResNet. It is our impression that network architectures have evolved to have more shift-invariance and better performance (eg., ResNet vs. Alexnet), at least until the recent popularity of transformer architectures. So greater shift-invariance has generally been associated with improved performance. We are not aware of prior publications that argue that CNNs would be expected to be less robust than less shift-invariant architectures. We are not sure why this would be naturally expected.",

    "comment": "Thanks for your thoughtful reviews and comments. We are addressing the concerns as follows.\n\n**Q1**: It doesn't differ much from previous work (Universal Adversarial Training, Shafahi et al., 2018). \\\n**A1**: We **respectfully disagree**. Our work differs largely with Shafahi et al., 2018 - solving different problems with different methodologies!\nFirst of all, the main contribution of our work is to introduce the min-max principle in attack design. However, Shafahi et al. proposed to use standard adversarial training (AT) to make the model robust to universal perturbations (where the universal perturbation is generated by **average strategy rather than the min-max strategy that we proposed**). Even on the defense side, we highlight two main differences: (1) Shafahi et al. proposed a min-max based AT by leveraging universal perturbations (rather than per-image perturbation). On the contrary, we generalize AT subject to mixed types of adversarial perturbations (multiple $\\ell_p$ perturbations). (2) Our min-max formulation (11) stems from the min-max-max formulation (18), where the last max step is conducted on the **importance weights $\\mathbf w$**, which is different from standard AT used by Shafahi et al.\n\n**Q2**: The authors perform many experiments on MNIST, but MNIST is known to be a poor dataset to study adversarial examples, especially in this experiment-based article. \\\n**A2**: First, we also conducted many experiments on CIFAR-10 in each setting (three attack tasks and generated adversarial training in defense). Compared to MNIST, we tested more advanced models (e.g., VGG16, Wide-ResNet, GoogLeNet) on CIFAR-10.\n\nSecond, MNIST is a good dataset for us to demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed min-max attack design. For example, we use MNIST to visualize the effect of self-adjusted weights on the attack performance (Figure 1 and Table 4). It is clear to see that the larger domain weights correspond to the MNIST letters with clearer appearance, implying that the learnable weights could offer visual interpretability of \u201cimage robustness\u201d. \n\nThird, we hesitate to call MNIST a poor dataset for studying adversarial examples. To the best of our knowledge, many seminal works [R1, R2, R3] considered MNIST as a standard dataset. A possible relevant point in [R3] is that one should consider different perturbation radiuses for different datasets; for example, ($\\epsilon = 0.2$, $\\ell_\\infty$ attack) used for MNIST becomes too large for CIFAR-10. In our work, we follow the commonly-used setting of the perturbation radius, 0.2 for MNIST, 0.05 or 0.03 for CIFAR-10.\n\n[R1] Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks.

Athalye et al., ICLR 2019. \\\n[R3] On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness. Carlini et al., 2019.\n\n**Q3**: \"As the authors have trained models on MNIST and CIFAR-10, why not demonstrate Table 2 on CIFAR-10 (relatively small improvements as shown in Appendix)? According to Table 1 and Appendix E, the method performs better on MNIST, I suspect it will perform worse on large datasets(e.g., ImageNet).\" \\\n**A3**: To address the reviewer's concern,  we conducted **extra experiments on CIFAR-10** and obtained consistent results as follows. Similar to Table 2, with the prior knowledge of robustness of given models ($C > D > A > B$), we devised several heuristic baselines including: (a) $w_{c+d}$: ensemble PGD on models C and D only; (b) $w_{b+c+d}$: ensemble PGD on model B, C, D only; (c) $w_{a+c+d}$: ensemble PGD on models A, C and D only; (c) $w_{clip}$: clipped version of C\\&W loss (threshold $\\beta = 50$) to balance model weights in optimization as suggested in [R4]; (d) $w_{prior}$: larger weights on the more robust models, $w_{prior} = [w_A, w_B, w_C, w_D] = [0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3]$; (e) $w_{static}$: the converged mean weights of min-max (APGDA) ensemble attack $w_{static} = [0.597, 0.042, 0.243, 0.118]$. \n\n|            | $Acc_A$ | $Acc_B$ | $Acc_C$ | $Acc_D$ | ASR$_{all}$ |\n|:----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|\n|   $w_{c+d}$  |  40.55  |  30.98  |   5.02  |   5.53  |   40.13   |\n|  $w_{b+c+d}$ |  42.12  |   1.63  |   5.93  |   4.42  |   51.63   |\n|  $w_{a+c+d}$ |  13.33  |  32.41  |   4.83  |   5.44  |   56.89   |\n|  $w_{clip}$  |  11.13  |   3.75  |   6.66  |   6.02  |   77.82   |\n|  $w_{prior}$ |  19.72  |   2.30  |   4.38  |   4.29  |   73.45   |\n| $w_{static}$ |   7.36  |   4.48  |   5.03  |   6.70  |   81.04   |\n|     avg    |  19.69  |   1.55  |   5.61  |   4.26  |   73.29   |\n|   minmax   |   7.21  |   2.68  |   4.74  |   4.59  |   84.36   |\n\nAs we can see, our proposed method outperforms all heuristic baselines by a large margin on CIFAR-10 as well, which again verifies the power of dynamically optimizing domain weights during the attack generation process. \n\nAs for the \u201crelatively small improvement on CIFAR\u201d, we kindly note that the *relative improvements* not only depend on the dataset but also depend on the model sets and attack strength ($\\epsilon$) as shown in Figure 2 and Table A3/A4. For example, our min-max strategy would lead to a significant improvement if victim models have diverse attack difficulties with moderate attack strengths.\n\nTo further alleviate reviewer\u2019s concern, we conducted **new experiments on ImageNet** - 1000 eval images [R4]. Specifically, we considered four models - VGG16, ResNet34, EfficientNet-B0 [R5] and ViT-B/16 [R6] and used the cross-entropy loss function. We set the attack iteration as 7, $\\epsilon=4/255$, step size as $1/255$  for attack generation. We set $\\beta=50, \\gamma=10$ for APGDA.\n\n|        | Acc_{VGG16} | Acc_{ResNet34} | Acc_{EfficientNet-B0} | Acc_{ViT-B/16} | ASR_all |  Lift |\n|:------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n|  clean |    69.90    |      74.30     |         77.10         |      72.60     |    -    |   -   |\n|   avg  |    11.20    |      1.50      |          5.20         |      19.60     |  75.30  |   -   |\n| minmax |     3.50    |      2.10      |          3.10         |      5.30      |  92.40  | 22.7% |\n\nAs we can see, APGDA achieves significant improvement for more advanced models on ImageNet.

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for thoughtful reviews and comments. We are glad that the reviewer believes that \u201csmoothifying and balancing weights are very interesting for the adversarial attack with multiple domains\u201d. We address the concerns as follows.\n\n**Q1**: The method is not that novel as it simply applies non-convex min-max optimization for adversarial attacks. The proposed min-max optimization and concave regularizer are mostly proposed in existing works like [45]. \\\n**A1**: First, we admit that robust optimization over multiple domains has been studied in the literature like [45]. **However, our paper has a very different research focus compared with the optimization literature.** To our best knowledge, this is the first work to identify the power of min-max principle in  **attack design**  and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on multiple attack generation tasks. Like adversarial training (Madry et al, 2017), although our attack framework is derived from robust min-max optimization, its formulation and generalization to different attack types are new to the adversarial community, which are recognized as \u201cnovel\u201d and \u201csignificant\u201d by other reviewers (cLBV, YmFH).\n\nMeanwhile, we would like to respectfully mention that the seemingly 'direct' application of min-max optimization does not mean that our contributions are minor, instead it is highly non-trivial to demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of our proposal in both attack design and robust training, and achieve superior performance in all examined scenarios. In both attack and defense, we show that the introduction of domain weights w is interpretable and has practical benefits since it adjusts the model robustness or attack power automatically during training, which makes the learning process more explainable. Finally, a significant experimental effort has been made to support our conceptual contributions.\n\n**Q2**: A very similar idea for ensemble attack via universal perturbation is explored in [G] (i.e., equation 13 in [G]) \\\n**A2**: Thanks for pointing out the reference! We would like to highlight that Eq. (13) is not proposed in [G] but proposed in another arxiv paper (Wang et al., 2019b) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03563.pdf], cited prior to Eq. (13).\n\nWe kindly bring the reviewer\u2019s attention that this arXiv paper should not be compared with ours. And we are **very sure** that our min-max attack framework is new and proposed for the first time. \n\n\n**Q3**: The proposed methods are not well compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks for generating universal adversarial perturbations [A-F]. \\\n**A3**: Thanks for providing the recent works on producing universal adversarial perturbations (UAP)! We will include them in the related work.\n\nFirst, UAP is merely one special application of our proposed min-max attack principle. Besides UAP, we explore the power of min-max principle in (1) ensemble attacks over multiple models, (2) robust attacks against different data transformations, as well as (3) adversarial training against multiple types of perturbation (Sec. 5.2). \n\nSecond, we kindly remind the reviewer that the problem setups [A-F] (e.g., studying the transferability, using the proxy datasets) are different from ours, which is orthogonal to these works in producing universal adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we are tackling the problem from the min-max optimization perspective instead of specific algorithmic customization. For instance, in the algorithms proposed in [A, B], there is step $g_\\delta \\leftarrow \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim B} [\\Delta_\\delta \\mathcal{L}]$, which calculates the gradients in the average formulation. We can actually adapt our approach by introducing learnable domains to make the gradients optimized in a more efficient way (attacking the worst-case image thus leading to a better trade-off). We will include more discussions on how our proposal has compatibility with the other specific UAP algorithms.\n",

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for thoughtful reviews and comments. We address the concerns as follows.\n\n**Q1**: Limited novelty from an optimization perspective. There are many papers in the literature using the same formation to solve such problems (see [1]) \\\n**A1**: We **respectfully disagree** with the limited novelty of our work. \n\nFirst, if [1] refers to \u201cSquare attack: A query-efficient black-box adversarial attack via random search, ECCV\u201920\u201d in our reference section, then it is significantly different from ours. If the reviewer meant [1] for another paper, please provide it. \n\nSecond, we admit that min-max optimization is a well-studied topic in the optimization literature. However, this does not restrict our novelty in the field of adversarial machine learning. \nThis is the **first solid step** to explore the power of min-max principle in the **attack design** and achieve superior performance on multiple attack tasks: (1) ensemble attacks over multiple models, (2) universal perturbations against multiple images, and (3) robust attack against different data transformations. We also showed that the application of min-max attack can advance (4) adversarial training against multiple types of perturbation, and achieves a new performance benchmark compared to the state-of-the-art MSD method (Sec. 5.2). The unified min-max attack is new to the adversarial community, which is recognized as \u201cnovel\u201d and \u201csignificant\u201d by other reviewers (cLBV, YmFH).  \n\nThird, we would like to respectfully mention that the seemingly \"direct\" application of min-max optimization does not mean that our contributions are minor, instead it is highly non-trivial to demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of our proposal in both attack design and robust training, and achieve superior performance in all examined scenarios. In both attack and defense, we show that the introduction of domain weights w is interpretable and has practical benefits since it adjusts the model robustness or attack power automatically during training, which makes the learning process more explainable. Finally, a significant experimental effort has been made to support our conceptual contributions.\n\n**Q2**: All formulations, lemmas, theorems use a basic idea/trick thus this work cannot be treated as a framework. \\\n**A2**: Thanks for your comment. The probabilistic simplex (together with its squared $\\ell_2$ regularization) provides us a novel view to attack multiple models, images, data transformations in a unified manner through the learnable importance weights. We strongly believe that this is new to the community of adversarial machine learning, which is recognized by other reviewers (cLBV, YmFH). Furthermore, the min-max attack idea was further leveraged to advance the defense setting (defense against multiple perturbation domains) and achieve the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. This again justifies that our proposal can be treated as a **novel framework** to explore and exploit adversarial robustness. \n",

    "review": "The proposed regularized formulation of adversarial attack appears to improveme the attack performance in all three settings. Empirically, the paper seems sufficient. However, the paper suffers greatly with issues in clarity. The paper as a whole could be improved greatly, and two parts that stand out are: \n\n1. The paper introduces their formulation as a problem of robust learning. This is somewhat misleading, as the \"robust learning\" in this paper is referring to a robust formulation of the adversarial attack, and not for updating the model parameters (i.e. \"learning\"). The latter is what I see most commonly in the literature for robust learning, and it is not clear to me that this is a formulation for adversarial attacks until Section 3. \n\n2. The results are not clear and require a lot of parsing. For example, the text refers to ensemble baselines, but it is unclear what in the table this refers to (I assumed it was the ones with \"avg\" under \"opt\", since the table captions refer to both attacks as ensemble attacks). There is a column in the table that is labeled \"Lift\" which seems to suggest an amount of improvement, however it is not clear to me what number or metric this is supposed to be improving and I could not find any explanatory text in either the caption or the text. \n\nOverall, the proposed formulation and the corresponding results seem alright. I do like how the authors studied a simple, generalized regularized formulation and evaluated it in multiple attack settings. However this was only after struggling to parse and understand the paper, the presentation of which was not very clear to me. \n\nOther minor questions/comments: \n\nThe convergence analysis (Theorem 1) appears to make very strong assumptions on the problem. Specifically, it is assumed that the problem has L-Lipschitz continuous gradients. Is this really a reasonable assumption for the setting considered in this paper (i.e. classification in deep networks)? \n\nThere are some recent works that improved upon the multi-perturbation robustness setting (over MSD) that would be nice to compare to, i.e. \"Learning to generate noise for multi-attack robustness\" (this is recent work, and so I did not hold this against the authors, but it would be nice to include in the final version). ",
    "comment": "Thanks for your thoughtful reviews and comments. We are glad to see the reviewer like our simple formulation and sufficient studies. We also appreciate the suggestions on improving the clarity of the presentation.\n\n**Q1**: \u201cRobust learning\u201d in this paper is referring to a robust formulation of the adversarial attack, and not for updating the model parameters (i.e., \u201clearning\u201d). \\\n**A1**: Thanks for pointing this out! We agree that the term \u201crobust learning\u201d might cause some confusion as it does not refer to the standard robust training or adversarial learning. We will replace the term \u201crobust learning\u201d with \u201crobust optimization\u201d in the revision.\n\n**Q2**: Ensemble PGD attack in the text but \u201cavg\u201d under \u201copt\u201d in the table. The \u201cLift\u201d metric is not introduced in the text. \\\n**A2**: Thanks for the suggestion. (1) We adopt ensemble PGD following the work [R1] which refers to the average formulation in the paper. We agree that it might cause confusion as both average or min-max PGD are ensemble attacks. Therefore, we would like to replace \u201censemble PGD\u201d with \u201caverage PGD\u201d to make it clearer. (2) For the \u201cLift\u201d metric, which refers to the relative improvement, the concrete definition is:\n$Lift = (metric_A - metric_B) / metric_B * 100\\\\% $ \\\nWe will add explanatory texts for this in the caption or the main paragraphs to make it clear.\n\n[R1] Iterative ensemble adversarial attack.

We will clarify those points that might cause confusion or be hard to parse in the revision.\n\n\\\nResponse to minor questions/comments:\n\n**Q3**: Strong assumptions in Theorem 1 ($L$-Lipschitz continuous for function $F$) \\\n**A3**: Thanks for the comment. First, we believe that the $L$-smoothness is a common assumption used in attack generation; see [Assumption 1; R2] and [R3]. This is because although the original neural network is non-convex, however, after restricting to a small neighborhood ($\\ell_p$-norm constraint), then the variation of the Hessian is bounded, enabling the $L$-smoothness within a local neighborhood of an input. Second, from the perspective of theoretical analysis, the L-smoothness is used as the standard assumption to proceed with the convergence rate analysis for the **nonconvex** min-max problem, as shown in [32] and [34] that we pointed out in Line 163.\n\n[R2] On the Convergence and Robustness of Adversarial Training.

[Example Review]  3  <<INST]   Originality:  The algorithm seems to be novel and differs from previous comparable approaches like CoreSet or BADGE. Related work is adequately cited.   Quality:  The authors show empirically that their algorithm, Cluster-Margin, is both more efficient (O(nlog(n) vs O(n\u221a(n)) than CoreSet and BADGE in practice and more effective. In particular, the algorithm clearly outperforms CoreSet, BADGE, Margin and Random on the Open Images dataset. The algorithm requires 29% less labels than the second-best model in the 100k batch-size setting and 60% less labels in the 1M batch-size setting to achieve the same result (mAP). Cluster-Margin also outperforms all other methods on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and obtains a similar performance on SVHN.   The authors also establish a theoretical guarantee for the Cluster-MarginV algorithm and show that those results hold for the Cluster-Margin algorithm in specific settings. In particular, they show that the Cluster-MarginV algorithm has a label complexity bound which improves over the Margin algorithm by a factor beta. They also show that this improvement is possible, under specific hypotheses like an optimal volume-based sampler, when the dimensionality of the embedding space is small or when the batch size k is large. They also show that the optimal volume-based sampler is approximately equivalent to the Cluster-Margin algorithm. They finally show that log(k) is an upper bound on the improvement of query complexity for any sampler.  The authors are aware and mention that their theoretical results are initial and that equating volume based samplers and the Cluster-Margin algorithm is an open research question.   Clarity:  The paper is very clear and well organized. The authors detail the hyper-parameters and compute details used for the experiments. The Cluster-Margin algorithm is also explained in detail.   Significance:  The results are important as the algorithm allows for more efficient and effective large-batch-size active learning compared to existing methods. The authors also provide initial theoretical guarantees to explain the improvements obtained with the Cluster-Margin algorithm. ]  4  [Example Split Points]  5  [Review to Split]  6  [Example Split Points]   The proposed regularized formulation of adversarial attack appears to improveme the attack performance in all three settings.

    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments. We would like to clarify some misunderstandings and address the concerns as follows.\n\n**Q1:** For Table 1, the proposed method performs worse in the $ACC_B$ metric. The same problem appears in Table A3, A4, and Table 5. \\\n**A1:** Instead of treating worse $ACC_B$ metric as a weakness or \u201cpotential error due to model selection\u201d, we believe, quite on the contrary, it clearly demonstrates the merit of the proposed APGDA algorithm - attacking against the **worst-case** environment that an adversary encounters while striking a balance with the easily-attacked environments. More specifically, in Table 1 ($\\ell_\\infty$ attack), since models C, D are more difficult to attack, APGDA wisely handles the worst case {C, D} by slightly sacrificing the performance on {A, B}: 31.47% ASR improvement on {C, D} vs. 0.86% degradation on {A, B}. We would like to refer the reviewer to Figure 1 for better explanations for this insightful phenomenon, as recognized by Reviewer YmFH.\n\nThe above empirical results show that compared to the averaging strategy, our min-max approach assigns attack strengths to multiple domains dynamically based on the attack difficulty and achieves a much better trade-off. There is no free lunch to achieve significant attack improvements across all different domains since the attacker shares the same attack setting (attack iteration $T$, perturbation magnitude $\\epsilon$, and attack step size $\\alpha$) in these different domains. Note that in the paper, we have provided detailed explanations why our proposed min-max approach leads to a better trade-off (Line 120-128, Line 185-210). \n\n**Q2.1**: The author conducted experiments (ensemble attacks) on MNIST with model ABCD but forgot to test EFH as tested on CIFAR-10. \\\n**A2.1**: We didn\u2019t conduct experiments on more complicated models (e.g. ResNet50, GoogLeNet) on MNIST due to the simplicity of this dataset. We believe that very large models are unnecessary for evaluation on MNIST since (1) A-D models can already achieve very competitive performance (99.5%), and (2) more complicated models easily lead to overfitting issues on MNIST. To further alleviate the reviewer's concern we conduct a new experiment to evaluate the model set {A, B, E, F} on MNIST: $\\ell_\\infty$ attack ($\\epsilon$ = 0.2).\n\n|        | $Acc_A$ | $Acc_B$ | $Acc_E$ | $Acc_F$ | ASR$_{\\mathrm{all}}$ |\n|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-----------:|\n|   avg  |   2.38  |   0.15  |  38.51  |  46.03  |    45.32    |\n| minmax |   3.54  |   0.44  |   6.38  |   9.17  |    86.28    |\n\nAs we can see, even in the presence of larger models E and F, our proposed min-max attack still outperforms the baseline with a large margin, consistent with our results in the submission. \n\n**Q2.2**: In Table A4's caption, all of the learning rate and regularization factors are the same as those in Table A3, but why change the parameter $\\epsilon$? \\\n**A2.2**: We change the parameter $\\epsilon$ since different models are associated with different attacking difficulties. For larger models E, F, H, it is easier to generate adversarial perturbations, and thus we decrease the maximum perturbation magnitude from 2.0 to 1.5 ($\\ell_2$ attack) and from 0.05 to 0.03 ($\\ell_\\infty$ attack). And changing $\\epsilon$ enables us to characterize a complete picture of the $\\ell_p$ attack diversity; Please refer to Figure 2 for a complete performance curve with varied epsilons. \n\n**Q3**: The proof of Theorem 1 seems not finished? \\\n**A3**: The proof of Theorem 1 is finished. Note that problem (4) is in a special form of min-max optimization, where the inner problem with respect to (w.r.t.) $w$ is a strongly-concave maximization problem, with $\\gamma$-Lipschitz continuous gradients. The only assumption that we impose on Theorem 1 is its $L$-smoothness w.r.t. the outer variable $\\boldsymbol \\delta$. However, the $L$-smoothness is a common assumption in attack generation; see [Assumption 1; R1] and [R2]. Now, given the smooth non-convex outer minimization problem plus the strongly concave inner maximization problem, the convergence of alternating gradient descent-ascent method can then be derived following the standard optimization literature, like [32] or [34] that we pointed out in Line 163. The proof is thus complete. We will add more proof details in the appendix for ease of understanding in the revision.\n\n[R1] On the Convergence and Robustness of Adversarial Training. Wang et al., ICML 2019. \\\n[R2] Robustness via curvature regularization, and vice versa. Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., CVPR 2019.\n\n**Q4**: PGD attack is not designed for \u201cuniversal attack\u201d so the performance cannot show the performance of proposed APGDA. \\\n**A4**: We would like to clarify that the \u201cPGD\u201d that we refer to is not the standard single-image PGD attack [R3], instead it follows the **general PGD optimization principle** to minimize the average of attack losses across multiple images for universal perturbation generation (see Eqn. (2) in [R4]). \nIn the revision, we will make the above point clearer and encourage the reader to treat PGD (projected gradient descent) as an optimization method instead of a specific attack method. As shown in [R4], PGD over the averaging multi-image attack loss leads to significantly better attack success rate and efficiency than other approaches (e.g, DeepFool in [R5], Adam, MSDG, SGD optimization on the average formulation [R4]). In our work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of min-max PGD (or APGDA) in building universal perturbations.\n\n[R3] Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks.

Moosavi-Dezfooli, et al., 2017.\n\n**Q5**: The noise size of the attacking models has not been fully considered. \\\n**A5**: We actually **have included** the results in the paper: Figure 2 and A1. As the perturbation radius $\\epsilon$ varies, we also observe that the ASR of min-max strategy is consistently better or on par with the average strategy (Line 209-210).\n\n",

    "review": "\n__Pros: Motivation, Clarity.__ There is a lot to like about this paper. The motivation is clearly articulated and easy to sympathize with: In order for RL agents to avoid safety violations while learning, it is sensible for agents to acquire a forward predictive model that can steer agent's behavior away from unsafe future states. This backdrop ideology frames much of the paper, which makes the definitions, method, and results fit very neatly with each other. I found definitions to be clear and succinct, as were proofs, assumptions, and most of the exposition in the paper. The decision to introduce irrecoverable states was quite sensible.\n\n__Con: Modelling Choices.__ Some aspects of the technical setup, while quite clearly presented, were more difficult to get behind. In particular, I was surprised to see that the introduced definition of an MDP only allows for deterministic transition functions. This seems like a dramatic simplification, particularly in the case of safe RL. If an agent only ever needs to experience a transition once to learn it, why should we worry about the compounding error phenomenon? Moreover, we need not worry about adding extra pseudo-rewards to prevent agents from landing in irrecoverable states, as in order to experience the pseudo-reward the agent will need to take the action that moves it to the irrecoverable state already. Since the transitions are deterministic, this single experience is enough (with or without the pseudo-rewards) to allow the agent to avoid such decisions in the future. For this reason I found the setup of the analysis quite puzzling. Another consequence of this decision to be mindful of is that it does not force a trade-off between safety and value. That is, there is no notion of risk. In a stochastic environment we might imagine that good behavior might trade off with the potential for a safety violation (which do we as designers care more about? Is safety a hard or soft constraint?). I believe these questions are important to address, but due to deterministic transitions they can be avoided entirely as a safety violation is effectively assigned the lowest reward and that's that. Perhaps this is okay, as the work might build toward the general stochastic case, but I did not see any mention of the choice to stick with deterministic dynamics, nor suggestions for how to relaxat to stochastic dynamics in the analysis. This is what puzzled me the most about the paper. Moreover, the environments used in Section 4. (Experiments) are not themselves deterministic, so I found quite a start contrast between the framing from the previous sections and the experimental section.\n\n__Writing Suggestions.__\n\n\n1. Introduction\n- \"spiking.Yet\" --> \"spiking. Yet\"\n\n3. Method\n- I found the definition of \"irrecoverable\" to be slightly confusing in the way that it is worded. I believe the phrase \"for all $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $Unsafe(s_t)$ for some $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$\". Having both quantifiers for some $t$ and for all $t$ is confusing. I see, on parsing this a few more times, it seems as though the first quantifier expresses the construction of the trajectory ($s_{t+1} = T(s_t, a_t)$), while the second quantifier expresses the existence of one unsafe state. I would suggest revising the wording here to make this more clear.\n- Similarly, in assumption 1, it would be useful to explicitly state that $s_0$ is irrecoverable (this happens in the first sentence of the assumption, but not the second). So: \"That is, if $s_0 = s$ is irrecoverable, then...\"\n- In Proposition 1, it is stated that \"if $a$ is a safe action (i.e. $T(s,a)$ is a safe state)\", but as I read it $T(s,a)$ should be a distribution over next states. Ah, I see, the transition function is actually defined to be deterministic. This seems to be quite a major limitation. I would have expected this to be emphasized early on: The compounding error problem cited at the beginning should not really be an issue for deterministic transitions, as the agent only needs to see a single transition per $(s,a)$ pair to learn the model.\n- From Prop 1.'s proof, it turns out that $C$ is actually lower than the minimal reward. This also seems potentially odd: We reserve a particularly low quantity of reward for unsafe states. This seems okay, but it is likely worth calling attention to the fact that C is less than $r_{\\min}$.\n\n- Why consider model-based algorithms that output a set of states? Are you aware of any algorithms that actually do this, and are themselves designed for deterministic environments? Why would this be a valid way to represent uncertainty in a deterministic environment, since a single experience of a transition will fully resolve any uncertainty?\n\n- Some of the references are off. Or, there is an odd convention at play that I found hard to follow. Definition 2 is labeled as such, but is referred to as Definition 3.2 (presumably since it appears in Section 3). I would suggest aligning these names. So either use \\numberwithin to enforce \"Definition 3.2\" to appear, or when referring to the definition, use the listed number.\n\n\n=============\n== Update after rebuttal\n\nIn light of the author's rebuttal, I believe the focus on deterministic-but-continuous environments is indeed suitably interesting. The linked pdf also provides a partial path toward the stochastic setting (though I believe more work is needed to adequately expose and handle risk, exploration, and other considerations). In light of this, I believe the paper will be much improved if it takes time to highlight the nature of the setting, motivating why deterministic-but-continuous environments are an interesting case for safety (and bringing closer attention to the choice of deterministic continuous MDPs). Consequently, I am raising my score from 4 to 6.",
    "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the many insightful comments! The main concern raised, which is that we assume deterministic dynamics, is indeed a limitation of the theory in the submission. However, this assumption does not make safety as trivial as the comments seem to suggest, considering that we allow for continuous state and action spaces. Although we only need to experience a transition once to know what happens for that $(s,a)$, in the continuous case there are infinitely many $(s,a)$ pairs and the agent is unlikely to experience the exact same transition again. Even if we know $(s,a)$ is safe, we cannot guarantee that a slightly different state and/or action would also be safe (without additional assumptions). For similar reasons, the issue of compounding error is still prevalent in deterministic dynamics when states/actions are continuous.\n\nMoreover, we have made progress on extending the theory to stochastic dynamics, please see here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j69Xq4aKqFa-1WcIn5bQc8hugcDLD_bw/view?usp=sharing\n\nEssentially, after modifying the definitions accordingly, the same strategy can be used to enforce that only sufficiently safe actions are chosen by the optimal policy.\n\nBelow we respond to some specific comments from the review:\n\n*  \"Moreover, the environments used in Section 4. (Experiments) are not themselves deterministic\" // The environments\u2019 transitions are deterministic. Only the initial state is randomized.\n* \"From Prop 1.'s proof, it turns out that C is actually lower than the minimal reward. This also seems potentially odd: We reserve a particularly low quantity of reward for unsafe states. This seems okay, but it is likely worth calling attention to the fact that C is less than rmin.\" // This is true, and for the sake of clarity we will add additional commentary pointing out this fact to the reader, but we would argue it is fairly intuitive that $-C$ should be less than $r_{\\min}$. If this were not the case, unsafe actions could have higher Q values than some low-reward safe actions, leading to potential safety violations.\n* \"Why consider model-based algorithms that output a set of states? Are you aware of any algorithms that actually do this, and are themselves designed for deterministic environments?\" // Set-valued prediction has long been used in statistics to represent uncertainty, e.g. confidence intervals/sets and conformal prediction. In deep model-based RL, it is common practice to employ ensembles of dynamics models to represent uncertainty (e.g. PETS, ME-TRPO, MBPO, ...) even when the dynamics are deterministic, and one can view the set of the models' predictions as a confidence set.\n* \"Why would [outputting a set of states] be a valid way to represent uncertainty in a deterministic environment, since a single experience of a transition will fully resolve any uncertainty?\" // It is true that under deterministic dynamics, any observed transition $(s,a,s')$ should lead to a confidence set containing only a single element. However, there remains the issue of how to predict for unseen states/actions. In continuous control problems where the state/action spaces admit a metric, one could use a Lipschitz assumption on the dynamics to produce a confidence set for states/actions which are close to the observed transitions.",

    "comment": "Thanks a lot for your positive feedback, valuable comments and helpful suggestions. In the following we would like to respond in detail to your comments. We addressed some of your concerns in our general comment to all reviewers, but would like to discuss some specific points you raised in the following.\n\n## Our Comments\n- __(C)__ *\"Blow up of Vanilla NDDEs is only shown on a single evaluation task.  Furthermore, it is not obvious to methat ANODE (at least, when used with true initial conditions) will fail at solving the two-link pendulum.Having more experiments would make this much better.\"* __(A)__ We  provide  a  second  blow  up  experiment in Appendix C.3, although for the less complex task of a stable, partially  observed harmonical oscillator. Concerning ANODEs: Since ANODEs with learned initial conditions achieved a poor training fit in our experiments (see Figure 2 and Figure 9), we decided to focus on NDDEs for the generalization experiments. However, in [1] blow up is also shown for a fully observed n-pendulum with neural network dynamics.\n\n- __(C)__ *\"There is a little ambiguity in the creation of the initial history: in particular, lines 248-254, I\u2019m not sure which data is used to train/fit the GP-mean, and if this is replaced/appended to at each iteration.\"* __(A)__ Thanks a lot for pointing this out. In our experiments the initial histories that are sampled for the regularization are resampled at each iteration. We will clarify this in line 254. These new initial histories sampled for the stabilizing loss are different from the ones learned from the training data. Is this sufficiently addressing your concern or have we missed something?\n\n- __(C)__ *\"As this is a stability-by-loss-function approach, there is also some concern on how well the stability generalizes. (Answering the question \u201chow likely are other trajectories produced by the model to be stable?\u201d) Presenting some experiment quantifying this would alleviate this concern.\"* __(A)__ Yes, it is true that we only experimentally showcase the generalization performance of our approach. In Figures 3(d) we see that while the median test loss is not exploding for Vanilla NDDEs, blow up occurs for the 0.95 quantile. On the other side, all independently trained regularized NDDE models remain stable in this experiment. In order to theoretically treat generalization, we will add a new theorem after line 241 in the paper, which establishes exponential decay based on continuous dependence of solutions (as outlined in detail in the comment to all reviewers).\n\n- __(C)__ *\"To make the results compelling depends on what this method can do in practice. Perhaps this could be showcased by performance on a more complicated common control-theory benchmark task (like a delayed or partially-observed cartpole?)\"* __(A)__ Great idea, thanks! We have added a stabilization experiment for a delayed cartpole to the experiments section (see comment to all reviewers for more details).\n    \n- __(C)__ *\"(Minor formatting issue: please consider allowing Latex to position figures instead of embedding them in text flow, It improves readability.)\"* __(A)__ Thanks for this hint. We will change this!\n\n- __(C)__ *\"For the delayed feedback control experiment, I suggest mentioning the selection of $\\tau = 0.03$ in the experimental section itself.\"* __(A)__ We changed this. Thanks for pointing this out!\n\n[1] Gaurav Manek, J. Zico Kolter, \"Learning Stable Deep Dynamics Models\"",

    "comment": "Thanks a lot for your feedback, valuable comments and helpful suggestions. In the following we would like to respond in detail to your comments. We addressed some of your concerns in our general comment to all reviewers, but would like to discuss some specific points you raised in the following.\n\n## Our comments\n- __(C)__ *\"The paper discusses little and conducts no comparison against the line of work from recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based effort on modeling system dynamics. Even though RNNs may lack the capability of modeling continuous dynamics, I think a more thorough discussion and empirical experiments here would increase the completeness of the work.\"* __(A)__ In lines 92-99 we quickly discuss how our NDDE approach is inspired by state augmentation in discrete-time models such as RNNs. Albeit discrete-time systems are both relevant and interesting, the focus of our work lies on pushing the current boundaries for continuous-time systems, motivating the choice of our comparisons.\n\n- __(C)__ *\"The model introduces a few parameters to tune: K, samples of historical observations, r, the length of history to consider, and alpha, q for the exponential stability of the learned system. The parameters are highly tailored with the system dynamics to learn. That is, you would not be able to learn a good model for a (internally) higher dimensional partially observed systems with a small K (this is mentioned by authors as there would not be a one-to-one mapping from internal states to the coordinates). I am expecting a discussion on choosing the parameters and a demonstration/analysis of performance of the method against these parameters.\"* __(A)__ Thanks a lot for pointing out this ambiguity. As mentioned in our general comment we would like to add a section on this. Due to the following reasons the above parameters can be chosen without in-depth knowledge about the system at hand:\n    - As for the number of delays $K$, it is correct that we will not be able to learn a good model with too few delays. However, our experiments have shown that a high value of $K$ eases training and is not hurting generalization performance. Throughout the paper (and also the experiments in Appendix C.3) we thus use a relatively large number of delays $K=10$. \n    - Our choice for the magnitude of the largest delay $r$ is indeed differing in our experiments. However, note that Theorem 2([1]) in Appendix B is (besides the periodicity condition) agnostic to the choice of the delay parameter $\\tau$. Nonetheless, in practice various heuristics such as *Average Mutual Information* or *False Nearest Neighbours* exist (for an overview see [2]). \n    - It is apparent from line 166-167 in Theorem 1([3]) that the parameter $q$ is directly related to the decay rate required by the Lyapunov-Razumikhin Theorem. This is underlined by our comments in line 228-230 and accordingly we are using $\\alpha \\approx \\log(q)/r$ in our experiments.\n\n- __(C)__ *\"The method bases on optimizing a loss function where a loss term is introduced to encourage stability. This only indirectly ensures stability. I am concerned that unseen observations could lead to non-stabilizing trajectories. If any theoretical guarantee could be established on this, it would increase the theoretical contribution of the work.\"* __(A)__ It is true that we only experimentally showcase the generalization performance of our approach (see Figures 3(b), 3(d), 4(a), 7, and 8(d)) and provide no theoretical discussion of generalization to unseen trajectories. To amend this, we will add a new theorem after line 241 in the paper, which establishes exponential decay based on continuous dependence of solutions (as outlined in detail in the comment to all reviewers).\n\n- __(C)__ *\"The experiments has only compared the method against ANODE where ANODE's failure is shown through non-matching phase plots, but the success of the proposed method is only shown through lower loss. This alone is insufficient in showing a better performance of the proposed method as the worse performing ANODE with learned IC achieves lower loss than ANODE with true IC. More experiments could help make the point clearer.\"* __(A)__ This is a typo in the legend of Figure 2(d) (see comment to all reviewers). Thanks a lot for pointing this out! Thus, the Figure demonstrates the point that learning initial conditions is one of the main bottlenecks of ANODE. Does this sufficiently address your concern or did we miss something?\n\n- __(C)__ *\"The method ports the established method of Neural Delay Differential Equations to the dynamics learning problem. The theoretical analysis of the method bases on established results clearly given in other papers -- The only theorem in this paper is given by [3]  . The experiments have not shown any special benefits of the method against existing methods. Therefore, I am concerned that the novelty of the work is not up to the standard of NeurIPS.\"* __(A)__ We added a discussion about novelty into the comment to all reviewers. While the approaches you mention certainly inspire our work, there are several technical subtleties when porting to continuous time, which require significant innovations.\n\n[1] Floris Takens, \"Detecting strange attractors in turbulence\"\n\n[2] Sebastian Wallot, Dan M\u00f8nster, \"Calculation of Average Mutual Information (AMI) and False-Nearest Neighbors (FNN) for the Estimation of Embedding Parameters of Multidimensional Time Series in Matlab\" \n\n[3] Denis Efimov, Alexander Aleksandrov \"On estimation of rates of convergence in Lyapunov-Razumikhin approach\"",

    "comment": "Thank you very much for your thoughtful feedback and questions!  \n$ $\n\n1. You commented \u201cThe reviewer felt the paper being insufficient since, although the theory is interesting, it is difficult to imagine how good the method works for real datasets. \u2026  In addition, it is desirable to have experiments for some datasets.\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    We agree that the proposed algorithm is not necessarily practical / effective for real data. The role of the algorithm is primarily to provide a theoretical verification of our lower bound (i.e., that our result in Theorem 1 is tight). More generally, the main aim of this work is to answer the question, \u201cwhen is inference possible?\u201d. In the setting that we study here, it turns out that the answer is somewhat mixed -- inference is possible in certain regimes and not in others. We do not view the negative results as a drawback to our work; indeed, our goal is to accurately characterize the regimes in which distribution-free inference is a meaningful target, and thus positive and negative results in different regimes are to be expected.  \n$ $\n\n    Of course, it is important to find meaningful and effective algorithms for the cases where the theory establishes that distribution free inference *is* possible, and we agree that it would be interesting to see how such procedures perform on real data -- this is beyond the scope of this work (where the algorithm we suggest is merely a \u201cproof of concept\u201d and is certainly far from optimal) but we look forward to exploring this question in future work as well.\n\n\n2. You commented \u201cIn the algorithm of Section 3, it seems not so obvious that we always estimate a finite effective support size $\\hat{M}_\\gamma$ in the algorithm even if the true distribution has an infinite effective support size.

Specifically, we can define $\\hat{M}_\\gamma = \\infty$ if there exists no $m$ that satisfies the inequality in the definition of $\\hat{M}_\\gamma$. Then $\\hat{M}_\\gamma$ will be $\\infty$ whenever the true $M_\\gamma = \\infty$.

    "review": "This is an important step forward in terms of theoretical understanding of the problem of honest adaptive inference for regression functions. As far as I know, previous works have not considered the \"effective support size\" as a parameter for the sample complexity of adaptive inference of functions.\n\nMoreover, the result in this paper is interesting. In one extreme, when the effective support size is $O (1)$, then estimating $\\mathbb{E}[Y | X = x]$ is essentially estimating the mean of $Y$ which gives us the usual parametric root-n rate. But in the other extreme, when the effective support size is $o (n^2)$, the confidence interval for each $x$ is still shrinking to 0, which is quite counterintuitive and indeed surprising to me (I would've guessed $o (n)$ is the phase transition point but Theorem 1-3 suggests otherwise). But regarding the second extreme case, I would like to see if the authors could provide a more intuitive explanation to convince me (please see comments (2)-(4) below), which I believe would help improve the reach of this paper in the general audience.\n\nBelow are my detailed comments.\n\n(1) I believe nonatomic or atomic distribution should be defined at the beginning of this paper, rather than delayed to page 4.\n\n(2) Can the authors provide a more intuitive explanation on the counterintuitive phenomenon that even when the support size is larger than the sample size, one can still make the confidence interval length shrink to zero?\n\n(3) Related to (2), it would be useful if the authors could provide more comments whether or not their results implicitly depend on the dimension $d$. One intuitive explanation I tried to come up with myself is when $d$ is finite, the locations without enough sample might be saved by the data nearby when the dimension is bounded. I am not quite certain. \n\n(4) Also related to (2), is it possible to get any meaningful bound on the variance of Lebesgue measure of the confidence sets? I understand most works focus on the expected Lebesgue measure but it might be interesting to also understand its randomness. But would it be that the variability of the size of the confidence interval is not small when the effective support size is greater than the sample size?\n\n(5) A related practical question is the following: as I mentioned, even if the feature $X$ is continuous, one may argue that in the computer at best one can only represent these numbers at a certain decimal accuracy, so essentially every data science question is about discrete or atomic distributions. Based on the result of this paper and other related papers that the authors cited, is it reasonable to simply discretize the distribution (assuming one-dimensional feature $X$) into bins and then make inference on the $\\mathbb{E}[Y | X \\in \\text{some bin}]$?

You commented \u201cI believe nonatomic or atomic distribution should be defined at the beginning of this paper, rather than delayed to page 4.\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    Thank you for this suggestion -- we agree and will make this change.  \n$ $\n\n\n2.  You commented \u201cCan the authors provide a more intuitive explanation on the counterintuitive phenomenon that even when the support size is larger than the sample size, one can still make the confidence interval length shrink to zero?\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    We agree that it would be good to have an intuitive explanation for the nontrivial in-between case. This result was surprising to us as well. We can try to explain the phenomenon by saying that the repeated values in the training set provide some information we need to construct a meaningful confidence interval, and the fact that the repeated observations are random leads to the coverage guarantee -- we will continue to try to make this intuition more clear in our revision.  \n$ $\n\n3. You commented \u201cit would be useful if the authors could provide more comments whether or not their results implicitly depend on the dimension.\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    In the distribution-free setting where we have no assumption on the distribution of $(X,Y)$, the structure of the space of $X$ has no significant effect on the inference in terms of the theory. Instead, our results suggest that the possibility of meaningful distribution-free inference is determined by the effective support size and the distribution of $Y|X$. In the case of real-world examples, high dimensionality may of course lead to a large support size. On the other hand, we might also find some real data settings where the different covariates are highly redundant, and so even though the space of possible $X$ values is large (and grows with dimension), it might be the case that only a tiny fraction of this space is needed to capture most values that are actually observed in real data (and perhaps this would grow only very slowly with dimension).  We appreciate this thoughtful point and will elaborate more on this point in our next draft, and will attempt to find real data examples to illustrate the different types of behavior of the effective support size that we might see in practice.  \n$ $\n\n4. You commented \u201c is it possible to get any meaningful bound on the variance of Lebesgue measure of the confidence sets? I understand most works focus on the expected Lebesgue measure but it might be interesting to also understand its randomness. But would it be that the variability of the size of the confidence interval is not small when the effective support size is greater than the sample size?\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    This is a very interesting question and we have not explored this - thank you very much for the suggestion! Our initial guess is that, if we think of the initial guess (the hypothesized function mu and the hypothesized support x^{(1)}, \u2026 ) as fixed, then in a setting where P_X is relatively \u201cflat\u201d (e.g., no single x^{(m)} with a very high mass relative to the others), concentration type results would probably yield a fairly stable calculation of the width of the confidence interval, even if M > n. However, this is only a guess and we will be sure to explore this interesting question.  \n$ $\n\n5. You commented \u201ceven if the feature is continuous, one may argue that in the computer at best one can only represent these numbers at a certain decimal accuracy, so essentially every data science question is about discrete or atomic distributions. Based on the result of this paper and other related papers that the authors cited, is it reasonable to simply discretize the distribution (assuming one-dimensional feature ) into bins and then make inference on the $E[Y|X \\in \\text{some bin}]$? If so, is there any reasonable strategy on how to perform such discretization?\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    Thank you for this important question. Theoretically, in the distribution-free setting where the information of nearby observations are not useful for the inference at a specific point, there is no guarantee that the binning technique will give us a good approximation. In particular, the inference target may move substantially -- $E[Y | X=x]$ might be very different from $E[Y | X \\text{ is in bin } b]$, where $b$ is a very small bin containing $x$. However, in many practical settings where we have some continuity of the distribution, the discretization might  work sufficiently well. Based on the point you raised, this would be an interesting topic to explore: could we construct a more practical and applicable inference procedure by slightly restricting the distributions of interest?\n",

    "review": "I think that the theory developed by this work so far is elegant. I found the paper easy to follow. The question that they consider I believe is significant, and the proposed solutions make sense. I read the proofs that are contained in the main paper (for the lower bound result), and they use some nontrivial techniques. \n\nHowever, I strongly believe that the work is incomplete on many fronts (more details below). While I have no doubt the authors will complete it adequately at some point, the paper is not currently in good shape to be accepted to Neurips. I have summarized some unanswered questions which I had, which indicate why (in my opinion) the paper is incomplete. I hope these questions provide the authors with meaningful feedback.\n\nLines 138-139: Given the close connections between Theorem 1 and Barber [2020, Theorem 2], it is unsatisfying that \\sigma_{P,\\beta} is not related to L_\\alpha(\\Pi_P) from Barber\u2019s work. Can the former be seen as an approximate to the latter? Is one of them always worse than the other? I request the authors to address these and related questions. \n\nWhile the lower bound and the algorithm proposed is quite general and in a novel setting, the main upper bound analysis (Theorem 3) is in a highly restricted setting where previous results also apply; more details are in the next point. Could the authors provide an end-to-end upper bound analysis (including the guessing part) in a setting where previous results do not apply or are weak? Some open questions which the authors do not address (I believe) are summarized below: \n\n- What is the relationship between Theorem 3 and Barber [2020, Corollary 1]? What is the relationship to Gupta et al. [2020, Theorem 4] (this latter result is a direct comparison since it essentially induces a finite and known support onto P_X, which is exactly the setup of Thm 3)? In particular, suppose instead of starting with a proposed mean function, I constructed a CI around the sample mean (as against around the mean estimate \\mu). (***; this point referenced below again) From what I can understand it should be possible to show a DF CI guarantee for such a CI; is that true? How would the length such a CI compare to the CI defined in (5)? \n\n- Step 1: A natural algorithm is to suggest a stream is to look at the histogram of the first split of the data. What is the 'generalization' behavior of this stream in terms of estimating M_\\gamma well? Basically, what about an eq. (2) style result but for the other direction; that is, the estimate \\hat{M_\\gamma} is not too larger than M_\\gamma. \n\n- How does Theorem 3 change if the support is not finite/known? For instance, if less than \\gamma fraction of the support is nonatomic? (also related to next question)\n\n- Step 2 of algorithm and err_\\mu assumption of Thm 3: Is there some prior literature (in non distribution-free setting), where err_\\mu can be bounded? Without knowing this, it appears that (***) can circumvent this altogether and we can directly construct a CI around the empirical mean which should work? Since Thm 3 is for fixed support, I am not sure if step 2 is perhaps helpful in the distribution-free setting when the support is not actually fixed or known.\n\nOther major comments: \n\nLine 99 and Thm 1: If the authors wish to allow M_\\gamma to take the value \\infty, then I believe that the proof of Theorem 1 needs to be made formally valid for this case. Else, Thm 1 should have as an 'assumption'  that M_\\gamma is not \\infty. Specifically, lines 268-273 in the proof do not parse if M_\\gamma is \\infty (to the best of my mathematical knowledge, these statements are not formal, although I agree with the conclusions). \n\nLines 199-201: In my opinion, these lines should not be a brief remark in parentheses. At the least, they should be in their own paragraph, and preferably, it would be helpful if the authors could elaborate further. (Personally, I felt that they are best placed near the beginning of Sec 3 where the concept of the \u2018initial guesses\u2019 is described.) My understanding is that for the theory, sample splitting is required, while in practice it may not be required. If the authors could expand on this, that would be useful. \n\nMinor comments: \n\nLine 23: the min() goes into the next line \n\nSteps 1 \u2013\u2013 3: I noticed that step 1 only cares about the n_b values, and the remaining analysis is conditional on n_b. Due to this, I believe if step 1 fails w.p. p, and step 3 fails w.p. q, then the overall failure probability I think is at most p + (1-p)q < p + q. Just an observation; not sure if it is useful or worth exploring. \n\nLine 190: \u201ctesting discrete distributions\u201d should be \u201ctesting properties of discrete distributions\u201d? It eventually became clear to me that \\mu(x) is to be thought of as the null hypothesis for the mean and we are \u2018testing\u2019 if \\mu_P(x) = \\mu(x). If you add 1-2 lines to this end, that could improve readability.\n\nLine 212: The parameter \\eta sort of comes out of nowhere and is a bit surprising while reading. \n\nLine 240: \u201cmay enables us\u201d -> \u201cmay enable us\u201d\n\nLine 246: \u201cThe proof is simple, and follows a standard argument\u201d: In my opinion, simplicity is subjective in this context, and the argument is not standard. Thus, I suggest that this qualification be removed. \n\nLine 267: The start of the proof of Theorem 1 is difficult to find without appropriate markers\n\nLines 287-288: \u201cimpossible to distinguish\u201d: Are P^n and P_mix \u201cimpossible\u201d to distinguish from each other (a test to distinguish them will have trivial power), or do you mean that a test to distinguish them will have low (but non-trivial power)? If the latter, then I think \u2018impossible\u2019 is not the right characterization. \n\nLine 301: The TV bound that that you use, sup_E |P(E) - Q(E)| \\leq TV(P, Q), should be stated explicitly since it may not be obvious to some readers.\n\nLine 303: I stumbled for some time on the first inequality; it may be useful to other readers to add one step\n\nReferences: Arxiv versions have been cited for some published papers\n",
    "comment": "Thank you very much for your detailed review -- we appreciate your thoughtful feedback and suggestions!  \n$ $\n\n1. You commented \u201cWhat is the relationship between Theorem 3 and Barber [2020, Corollary 1]? What is the relationship to Gupta et al.

How would the length such a CI compare to the CI defined in (5)?\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    These results are not directly comparable but we will give a sketch of how they differ here.  \n$ $\n\n    --- To compare to Barber (2020, corollary 1) --- in that work, the simplicity of the binary-response setting allows for an exact lower bound that is matched by an upper bound for which the constant is tight. In other words, the result looks like \u201cupper bound <= lower bound + $o(1)$\u201d, rather than something like \u201cupper bound <= C * lower bound\u201d. In fact, for that paper, a multiplicative constant in the result would lead to a meaningless result, since the lower bound is $O(1)$ and so a trivial way to prove that \u201cupper bound <= C * lower bound\u201d would be to take the meaningless confidence interval $[0,1]$.  \n$ $\n\n    In contrast, in our present work, the lower bound is not necessarily $O(1)$ --- in particular, the lower bound is $o(1)$ whenever the effective support size is $\\ll n$ . Therefore, our upper bound in Theorem 3, which has the flavor \u201cupper bound <= C*lower bound\u201d, is nonetheless meaningful in this setting. It would be substantially more complex to get the right constant in the non-binary response case, and while we are able to do this with implicit expressions we do not have an interpretable form for the result and so we have chosen to give bounds that are tight only up to constants for the sake of clarity and ease of reading.  \n$ $\n\n    --- To compare to Gupta et al (2020, theorem 4) ---  This is actually a highly different setting. The idea of calibration via binning is essentially to make the inference target substantially easier, by aiming for a regression function $E[Y | bin(X) ]$ rather than $E[Y | X]$ , where $bin(X)$ denotes conditioning on the (discrete) variable that assigns $X$ to its bin. The goal of our present paper is to explore the regimes of possibility and impossibility for the problem $E[Y|X]$. Certainly the fact that it is impossible in many settings of practical interest, leads to a natural motivation for relaxing the inference target and considering options such as calibration, but the two problems are fundamentally different.   \n$ $\n\n    An interesting point is that the results in our paper suggest that we might be able to weaken the goal of calibration, and can may be able to construct effective calibration algorithms with $> n$ bins (as long as it\u2019s $\\ll n^2$ bins). The calibration algorithm in Gupta et al, in contrast, considers the regime of o(n) many bins (because each bin\u2019s confidence interval is constructed to be individually valid, rather than the on-average definition of validity considered in our work). We will comment on this possible extension in the next draft of our paper.  \n$ $\n\n2. You commented \u201cStep 1: A natural algorithm is to suggest a stream is to look at the histogram of the first split of the data. What is the 'generalization' behavior of this stream in terms of estimating M_\\gamma well? Basically, what about an eq. (2) style result but for the other direction; that is, the estimate \\hat{M_\\gamma} is not too larger than M_\\gamma.\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    Our work does not consider the core estimation problem -- this is intentional, as it follows the spirit of much of the inference literature where the goal is to provide \u201cwrapper\u201d methods which can provide inference or uncertainty quantification for pre-existing algorithms; that is, inference methods that can be paired with any estimation algorithm that the analyst chooses to use. This type of approach appears in the conformal prediction literature for distribution-free prediction (which is a large part of the inspiration behind our work) where valid prediction intervals are built around the predictions coming from any \u201cblack box\u201d prediction algorithm; as well as in more classical methods. This decoupling of the two stages of the method, is part of the appeal of these \u201cwrapper\u201d methods, since they allow for valid inference to be built around any desired initial algorithm, meaning that we can use the most powerful algorithms at our disposal --- in other words, we do not have to limit ourselves to some specific, easy-to-analyze algorithm for the sake of enabling inference to be performed. Of course, this framework comes at a cost -- specifically, we cannot say anything about the power or \u201cgeneralization behavior\u201d since it completely depends on the underlying distribution and algorithm that was used at the estimation stage. We will add some comments to clarify this in the paper; and in addition can comment on certain special cases where known methods will produce good results.  \n$ $\n\n3. You commented \u201cHow does Theorem 3 change if the support is not finite/known? For instance, if less than \\gamma fraction of the support is nonatomic?\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    If the support is entirely unknown (for example, our hypothesized $x^{(1)}... x^{(M)}$ are entirely wrong), then (informally) it will be impossible for us to determine the effective support size of the distribution --- we will see many X values that appear only once, and that are \u201cunexpected\u201d (i.e., do not appear in our list of $x^{(m)}$\u2019s), so we will not be able to distinguish between, e.g., a distribution with support $M=n^{1.5}$ versus a distribution with a large nonatomic component. [Note -- there are many results in the literature for estimating the support size of a *uniform* distribution, but if we do not assume uniformity or any other constraint, then we cannot determine the support size if we have no information or guess about the support]. Essentially, our initial guess\u2019s poor quality will lead to an overly conservative (but still valid) interval.  \n$ $\n\n4. You commented \u201c Step 2 of algorithm and $err_\\mu$ assumption of Thm 3: Is there some prior literature (in non distribution-free setting), where $err_\\mu$ can be bounded? Without knowing this, it appears that (***) can circumvent this altogether and we can directly construct a CI around the empirical mean which should work? Since Thm 3 is for fixed support, I am not sure if step 2 is perhaps helpful in the distribution-free setting when the support is not actually fixed or known.\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    Yes - for example, if the true function mu(x) is smooth, then certainly we can estimate mu accurately (e.g., using half the data, and via a method such as k-NN or other methods appearing in the nonparametric regression literature). We will clarify this point in our next draft.  \n$ $\n\n5. You commented \u201cLine 99 and Thm 1: If the authors wish to allow M_\\gamma to take the value \\infty, then I believe that the proof of Theorem 1 needs to be made formally valid for this case. Else, Thm 1 should have as an 'assumption' that M_\\gamma is not \\infty.

We apologize for the ambiguity in our notation and proof. Yes, we do allow for $M_\\gamma$ to be infinity; the necessary adjustments to the proof are very minor and we will be sure to correct the gap in the next draft. (Essentially, the lower bound for the case $M_\\gamma(P_X) = \\infty$ is at least as large as for the case $M_\\gamma(P_X)=M$, for any finite $M$; by taking $M$ to be sufficiently large, we establish the desired result, which is a constant-length lower bound.)  \n$ $\n\n6.

Apologies if this isn\u2019t the step you are referring to --- we were not sure since there are multiple lines of the equation at this single line number.  \n$ $\n\n2. You commented  \u201cwhy did you pick the measure of \"concentration\" (I'm using that word somewhat loosely here) that you did? I.e., why not / are there others (e.g., controlled Orlicz norm, smoothness, entropy, ... ??) that might also make the proof work out, and possibly lead to slightly different conclusions?\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    We agree that it could be possible to have other measures on $P_X$ that lead to similar results, but we are not aware of any specific measure that would work. For example, if we interpret \u201csmoothness\u201d to mean that $P_X$ has a density that satisfies some smoothness property, any such $X$ is nonatomic, meaning that $M_\\gamma(P_X)$ is infinity and, by our Theorem 1, it will therefore be impossible to have vanishing-length distribution-free intervals. But, it is certainly possible that there are alternatives to $M_\\gamma$ and we will explore this question in future.  \n$ $\n\n3. You commented \"So, what kind of conditions on the conditional law of $Y|X$ might be sensible to make here, to circumvent Theorem 1? From looking at the proof, it's not totally clear, but maybe some kind of shape constraint? Also, if I just agree to give up on coverage in certain parts of the input space, that would be fine / potentially get me around Theorem 1, right?\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    For the first point -- yes, assumptions on the conditional law of $Y|X$ would certainly lead to much stronger results -- for example if we simply assume $\\mu(x)$ is smooth (at some known level, e.g. Holder smoothness with some exponent) then the nonparametric regression literature offers a very precise understanding of what is possible. Shape constraints, and other constraints, will also likely lead to good results. An interesting point, however, is that Theorem 1 implicitly tells us that any such property is untestable if $X$ is nonatomic or has effective support $M>n^2$. The reason is this: suppose it is possible to test this property, and if the data \u201cpasses\u201d the test (e.g., we conclude that the shape constraint is satisfied) then we build the confidence interval according to the assumption (e.g., a confidence interval that makes use of the shape constraint assumption) while if the data \u201cfails\u201d the test then we simply output $[0,1]$ as our confidence interval. Then Theorem 1 says that this confidence interval --- if it has distribution-free validity --- cannot have vanishing length, on average. This means that the data must \u201cfail\u201d the test with positive probability --- in other words, it\u2019s not possible for the test to detect, with high accuracy, that the assumption is satisfied.  \n$ $\n\n    For the second point --- the definition of a valid confidence interval is weak, and requires only that coverage must have $1-\\alpha$ probability *on average* over the (training and test) data. In particular, it\u2019s fine if there is some fraction of $X$ space where coverage is zero, as long as this is counterbalanced by higher coverage elsewhere. Thus, the current framework already allows for us to \u201cgive up\u201d on coverage in certain regions of $X$ space.  \n$ $\n\n4. You commented \u201cI assume the restriction of $Y \\in [0,1]$ can be weakened to something like $Y \\in [0,C]$, for some (finite) constant $C > 0$, at the expense of slightly more annoying proofs\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    Yes, our result can be applied to any bounded variable $Y$ - we just need some scaling to apply the version of the theorems in the paper. However, the bound does need to be known/assumed (as the counterexample in the paper illustrates --- if no bound is assumed, then we cannot exclude the possibility that there is a vanishingly small probability on an extremely large value, which will essentially never be observed but will perturb the mean by an arbitrary amount.  We will add a comment to clarify this in the next draft.  \n$ $\n\n4. You commented \u201cHow important is the i.i.d. assumption (vs. just exchangeability)?\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    For the upper bound, the i.i.d assumption is used multiple times in our proofs to derive probabilistic bounds theoretically - working only with exchangeability might be much more challenging. On the other hand, for the lower bound this is an interesting question to explore and we will look into this, thank you for the suggestion.  \n$ $\n\n5. You commented \u201cWhat if $\\hat{C}_n$ is random? I assume nothing really changes once you take the probability/expectation over any randomness inherent to $\\hat{C}_n$\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    Yes, the results hold regardless of whether $\\hat{C}_n$ is assumed to be a random or deterministic function of the data -- we will be sure to make this more explicit in the next draft.  \n$ $\n\n6. You commented \u201cI might suggest running a few simulations as a check on the construction in Section 3, but I guess that's not really the point of the paper.\u201d  \n$ $\n\n    Thank you for the suggestion. As you pointed out, the focus of our work is to investigate the possibility of distribution-free inference rather than finding or improving algorithms for a good performance in practice. That said, it would be interesting to check how it works empirically and see if there\u2019s room for improvement. In particular, we hope to explore the question of effective support size in real data sets (e.g., we might hope to find scenarios where despite a very large space of possible $X$ values, the majority of real data points fall into a much smaller set -- for instance, if there are multiple covariates that are generally highly redundant).\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for your encouraging review, and useful comments. We would like to discuss the points raised in your review. \n\n--- \n\n**Notational clarity** \n\nSince the submission in May we have revised and simplified the notation we use in order to make the theoretical parts of the paper more accessible. On the two specific questions you asked: \n- what is $\\bar{z}$ in Definition 1?: we let $z$ and $\\bar{z}$ denote any two points in our latent space $\\mathcal{Z}$, so $\\bar{z}$ plays a symmetric role to the variable $z$. \n\n- What is $S^c$ in l.194?: $S$ is a subset of the discrete set $[n]=${$0,1,2, \\ldots, n$}. We use $S^c$ to denote the complement of $S$ in \\{$0,1,2, \\ldots, n$}. \n\nWe will update the paper to clarify both of these points.\n\n--- \n**Adapting IFM to Siamese methods (e.g. SimSiam and BYOL)** \n\nOur method could be adapted to Siamese methods, but with one additional complication. IFM is defined via a maximization problem over perturbations in embedding space. With SiamSiam, for example, these perturbations would need to be computed *after* the projection head, but *before* the predictor MLP. Computation would require using gradient accent with backpropagation through the predictor MLP. Since the predictor MLP is small this would be relatively inexpensive, but would still add some computational overhead. This approach also lacks the analytic expression for the IFM loss (Eqn. 2) in the contrastive learning setup. In this work we decided to focus on contrastive methods, since much of our motivation for IFM comes from Section 2, which considers properties (e.g. hardness) of the *instance discrimination* task. Since Siamese methods do not use instance discmriniation, the observations in Section 2 do not directly transfer. We agree, however, that analyzing feature learning in Siamese methods is a valuable direction for future work.\n\n---\n\n**ImageNet-1k experiments** \n\nWe would very much like to run ImageNet-1k experiments. However, computational resource constraints make this very difficult for us. We are attempting to run these experiments, but they are extremely time-consuming (on the order of many weeks to train). If we are able to complete these experiments we look forward to including them. \n\nWe welcome any further questions, and are very happy to discuss further.\n",

The fundamental problem of models that take shortcuts to achieve high levels of performance on a training set, but perform poorly in practice, is extremely common and often addressed only in ad hoc ways.  The authors present one of the first methods of which I am aware by which this issue can be systematically addressed, they motivate/analyze it theoretically, and provide compelling empirical results to support its practical significance.

    "comment": "We are glad that you value to practical implications of our work, and its contribution to understanding the problem of shortcuts. We also especially appreciate your effort in compiling a list of useful actionable improvements to the paper. We will incorporate all of them into the paper, and they will improve the paper and its readability further.\n\nBesides these useful suggestions, your review also raises several questions, which we clarify next. \n\n---\n\n**The computational cost of IFM:** IFM introduces (essentially) zero computational overhead. Figure 5 shows a comparison of both memory and runtime between SimCLR and IFM demonstrating this. The reason is that, although defined via a maximization problem, IFM can be computed analytically using a simple perturbation of the logits (as shown in Eqn. 2).\n\n\n**The space $\\mathcal{U}$ in l.92:** $\\mathcal{U}$ is any measurable space. We use this to define the pushforward measure in full generality (which is defined for any two measurable spaces $\\mathcal{U}, \\mathcal{V}$ and any $f:\\mathcal{U} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}$). In our theoretical analysis, the particular instance of the pushforward we use is with $\\mathcal{U}$ equal to the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1} =$ {$ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d : ||x||_2 = 1$}.\n\n**What is $m$ in \u201cnumber of negatives $m$ goes to infinity\u201d, l.112?:** We define $m$ in Eqn (1). It is the size of the batch of negatives used in the InfoNCE loss. We will add further clarification to l.112 so the reader does not have to refer back to (1).\n\n**The limit LFS \u2192 RHS in l.112**: We will add the derivation in the appendix, and refer the reader to the details if they are interested.\n\n**The sensitivity to $\\alpha$ (the weighting between the InfoNCE and the perturbed loss):** We did not tune $\\alpha$. When designing our experiments we decided to value simplicity more highly than attaining optimal performance. It may be possible to further improve the performance of IFM by tuning alpha. However, our experiments suggest that indeed $\\alpha=1$ is a generally sensible choice. We are happy to add an ablation in the appendix where we vary $\\alpha$.\n\n**What does \"$\\mathcal{L}_\\epsilon$ only\" mean in Fig. 7?:** It means that  instead of the default IFM loss, which is the sum with the standard InfoNCE loss, $(\\mathcal{L}_\\epsilon +\\mathcal{L})/2$, we only optimized the loss $\\mathcal{L}_\\epsilon$. We will make sure to clarify this in an updated version of the paper. We found that $\\mathcal{L}_\\epsilon$ performs similarly to $\\mathcal{L}$ on average (76.0% vs 75.9% on average across all 8 runs). We will add confidence intervals that should further clarify this. \n\n**Confidence intervals for Table 1:** We agree this valuable and are running these experiments now. We will add the results to the paper. Unfortunately, due to computational constraints they have not yet finished.\n\n**Statistical significance for Table 2:** The bold face in Table 2 indicates the best average performance in 5-fold cross-validation. We will clarify this in text and update the figure to carefully denote account statistical significance. \n\n---\n\nFinally, thank you for pointing out typos, incorrect appendix references (C.5 vs C.6) and points on style (e.g. \u201cdiscussion\u201d vs \u201cconclusion''). We will also incorporate these into the paper. \n",

    "submission_title": "Can contrastive learning avoid shortcut solutions?",
    "review": "I think this is a technically sound, novel contribution to the contrastive learning literature. I think the proposed method conceptually makes sense. Some of the experiments seem to be pretty well done. However, some experiments do not have any error bars (e.g. Figure 7-8, Table 1). Are those effects significant? Also, the reported improvements are rather small and the need to tune an additional hyperparameter (epsilon) makes the proposed scheme practically unappealing. I also want to point out that the authors never do a proper cross-validated experiment: they just show the results for different epsilon values (e.g. Figure 7, Table 2), which again makes me wonder if these effects would survive a properly cross-validated experiment. \n\nI also had a more high level objection that I wanted to mention. This is more of an objection to contrastive learning in general, rather than this particular paper, but the point is that what papers like this really show for me is that instance discrimination and similar objectives as self-supervised learning objectives are fundamentally flawed (although they happen to work quite well at the scales where we're currently testing them), because there\u2019s no guarantee that they will learn the \u201cintended\u201d representation. These objectives already require quite a bit of manual data augmentation engineering to cajole the model into learning the \u201ccorrect\u201d representation and papers like this suggest that even then these methods are not entirely successful at preventing shortcut learning. So, instead of trying to patch these issues with ad-hoc fixes like this paper tries to do, I think it would be more productive over the long term to adopt more principled self-supervised learning objectives in the first place (for example, likelihood-based generative objectives), where at least in the limit of large data, we know that they will learn the right features.",
    "comment": "Thank you for your review, and encouraging comments. We are glad that you appreciated the various components of this work, including technical soundness, novelty, and execution of experiments. \n\nYour review raised a number of points, which we discuss below.\n\n---\n\n**Cross-validation and error bars** \n\nWe fully agree that this is a valuable addition to the experimental results and **will add 5-fold cross-validation to all remaining plots in an updated version of the paper** (for STL10 and ImageNet100 datasets we will instead run multiple seeds and add error bars). \n\nDue to computational constraints, we have partial results so far. The results reported below use 5-fold cross-validation, and report 95% confidence intervals.\n\n```\nDataset: CIFAR100\n\n      Method       | epsilon | avg. accuracy | 95% CI |\n-------------------------------------------------------\nMoCo-v2            |   N/A   |     68.31%    | \u00b10.61% |\nMoCo-v2 w. dropout |   N/A   |     68.16%    | \u00b10.78% |\nIFM-MoCo-v2        |   0.1   |     69.80%    | \u00b10.60% |\n```\n\n```\nDataset: CIFAR10\n\n   Method   | epsilon | avg. accuracy | 95% CI |\n-------------------------------------------------------\nMoCo-v2            |   N/A   |     91.69%    | \u00b10.25% |\nMoCo-v2 w. dropout |   N/A   |     91.84%    | \u00b10.13% |\nIFM-MoCo-v2        |   0.1   |     92.28%    | \u00b10.20% |\n```\n\n```\nDataset: tinyImageNet\n\n   Method   | epsilon | avg. accuracy | 95% CI |\n------------------------------------------------\nMoCo-v2     |   N/A   |     51.78%    | \u00b10.50% |\nIFM-MoCo-v2 |   0.1   |     52.41%    | \u00b10.52% |\n```\n```\nDataset: ImageNet-100\n\n   Method   | epsilon | avg. accuracy | 95% CI |\n------------------------------------------------\nMoCo-v2     |   N/A   |     80.45%    | \u00b10.11% |\nIFM-MoCo-v2 |   0.1   |     80.91%    | \u00b10.25% |\n```\n\nThese results show that IFM also yields statistically significant improvements when using cross-validation. We will also follow up at the end of the rebuttal period if further results have finished running by then.\n\nWhile we continue to prepare additional results, we would also like to emphasize that across all 5 datasets considered and with both SimCLR and MoCo-v2 frameworks, each $\\epsilon$ in the set {$0.05, 0.1, 0.2$} improved performance over the baseline (and so did $\\epsilon=0.5$ in 7 out of 8 cases). The consistency of this observation across different experimental settings gives us high confidence in the overall conclusion that IFM improves over the baseline. \n\n---\n\n**Other ways of reducing feature suppression** \n\nIt is possible that methods such as dropout may also help with feature suppression. However, we view the value of IFM as coming from its motivation via the observations in Section 2 on the relation between shortcut learning and instance discrimination. That IFM is motivated in this way serves two purposes: 1) it shows that the understanding developed in Section 2 can help inspire new methodology, and 2) conversely, the effectiveness of IFM further validates the viewpoint developed in Section 2.\n\n---\n\n**Tuning the parameter $\\epsilon$** \n\nWe are able to offer a sensible default setting: $\\epsilon=0.1$. As noted above, all epsilon values {$0.05, 0.1, 0.2$} improved performance on all datasets, however $\\epsilon=0.1$ marginally outperformed $0.05$ and $0.2$ on average. That all three of the settings {$0.05, 0.1, 0.2$}  yielded improvements suggests that $\\epsilon$ is not a sensitive hyperparameter. \n\n---\n\n**Fundamental limitations of instance discrimination** \n\nWe fully agree that contrastive instance discrimination is intrinsically difficult to guide towards learning the \u201ccorrect\u201d representation (as are all augmentation-based self-supervised methods, e.g. BYOL, Barlow Twins, SwAV). Indeed this is one of the takeaways from our work. We think this problem is one of the major open questions in representation learning, and intersects with many other lines of research including distributional robustness, domain adaptation, out-of-distribution generalization, implicit biases, and more. \n\nAlthough this criticism is not specific to our work (as you mentioned), we would still like to offer two reasons why IFM is a valuable contribution with this open challenge in mind. First, in the absence of more principled methods (which may take years to develop), it is of interest to build new tools that can be immediately deployed by practitioners. Second -- and we think this point is especially important -- the efficacy of IFM serves as a final validation of the observations in Section 2 (which motivated IFM).

    "comment": "Thank you for your review.\nThe major differentiating factor between our and previous ski-rental algorithms is that our guarantee is a smooth (tight) function of the prediction error (which is also used in the DPM reduction), whereas previous works focused on the two extremes of perfect predictions vs worst-case predictions. Although Purohit et al. [35] actually also state a guarantee that could be phrased as $(\\rho,\\mu)$-competitiveness, in their case one has $\\mu=\\rho\\ge 1$. Note that this guarantee is already trivially achieved by the algorithm that fully trusts the predictions, which is $(1,1)$-competitive. Interestingly, the best version of the algorithm of [35] in our experiments on the dataset of [35] is the $(1,1)$-competitive one. This might be additionally indicative of the notion of $(\\rho,\\mu)$-competitiveness being more useful for practical performance than merely optimizing robustness and consistency. Our new experiments (see our response to reviewer LdW3) also show a significant improvement on real-world data.    \n\nThere might have been a misunderstanding regarding robustness/consistency: When considering a single ski-rental instance in isolation, one typically requires $c=0$ in the definition of competitiveness (end of page 2; otherwise the problem would be trivial by buying at time 0 and choosing $c$ equal\ufeff to the buying cost) and Purohit et al. obtained the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off for this setting. When several successive ski rental instances are considered, or a single DPM instance involving several idle periods, it is more common to allow a positive additive constant $c$ (since it is of negligible size compared to the overall cost). For this setting, one can achieve near-optimal consistency and robustness without the need to make any trade-off, and this is also (part of) the purpose of Theorem 5: It gives a *single* algorithm with consistency $1+\\epsilon$ and robustness $e/(e-1)+\\epsilon$ (and its performance degrades gracefully between these two values as the prediction error increases). Our other theorems show that one can achieve $(\\rho,\\mu(\\rho))$-competitiveness for a fixed value of $\\rho$, and Theorem 5 shows that rather than having to choose $\\rho$ in advance, there is an algorithm that is $(\\rho,\\mu(\\rho))$-competitive for all $\\rho$ at the same time. So we do not skip over robustness, but rather we achieve near-optimal robustness (provided one allows $c>0$).\n",

    "review": "Thank you for submitting to NeurIPS.\n\nI enjoyed reading the paper. The results are easy to parse and the proof techniques are clearly presented.\n\nThe main weakness of the paper, in my view, is that the relation to dynamic power management in environments such as data centers is quite vague. This relation is highlighted in the first few paragraphs of the Introduction but is never revisited afterwards. The specific characteristics of different power-saving mode, the patterns of idle time periods and the extent to which these can be predicted in data centers, etc., are never discussed. Since dynamic power management is supposedly the \"killer app\" for the presented algorithms, I think that these issues should be discussed.\n\nThis also relates to the presented experiments. The evaluation framework is very limited and is quite detached from the motivating example. For instance, the drawing requests uniformly at random and considering predictions that are random perturbations of the actual labels seems overly simple. I realize that this was done in [35], too, but there the key goal was illustrating the usefulness of predictions for online algorithm, as opposed to tackling a specific problem, as is done here.\n\nIn light of the above, this paper should, in my view, be evaluated as a theoretical paper about the ski-rental problem. As such, I'm not sure that the results are sufficiently significant.\n\nFollowing the authors' response:\n\nThank you for the detailed answer. I still have an issue with the positioning of this paper. I'm adjusting my score to 5.",
    "comment": "We are glad to hear that you enjoyed reading our paper. You are right to conclude that the core of our contribution is theoretical (most importantly, tight bounds as a function of prediction error for one of the most fundamental online problems, whereas previous guarantees focused only on the extremes of perfect predictions and worst-case predictions).\n\nWe agree that our evaluation framework was limited. To address that issue we decided to run an additional experiment with a real-world scenario. Unfortunately, although some of the previous work on DPM that we cite includes experiments, these papers are not recent and the datasets used in them are no longer available. For that reason, we used I/O traces from Nexus 5 smartphone available at http://iotta.snia.org/traces/block-io. We took the five largest traces, from which we extracted durations of idle periods between requests. We haven't found power states specification for that smartphone, hence we used the same power states as for the synthetic experiments, i.e. an IBM mobile hard-drive's power states reported in [25]. Because of that, we had to scale up idle periods so that they have similar order of magnitude as in the synthetic experiments. For this real-world dataset, we also implemented a simple \u201creal\u201d predictor that generates predictions from past data using a multiplicative weight \u201cShare update\u201d learning algorithm of Herbster and Warmuth [21]. The competitive ratios obtained with this predictor, combined over the above smartphone datasets, are as follows:\n>\n        1.133 Our algorithm\n        1.143 FTP  \n        1.145 PSK\n        1.146 Robust FTP \n        1.147 ADJKR\n        1.401 Classical Online e/(e-1)-competitive\n\nMore detailed results for specific datasets can be seen here: https://imgur.com/a/RQ71Pmr\nIn particular, on each dataset, either our algorithm performs better than all others, or blindly following predictions (FTP, non-robust) is best and our algorithm is almost as good. We will include these new real-world experiments in the final version of our paper.\n\nWe will expand the discussion about practical DPM environments in the final version. In a data center environment, DPM is usually used on each machine independently and the sleep and active states usually correspond to the power states of the given machine, see paper on DPM for multi-tier data centers by Lim et al. (ISPASS'11). However, since applications are so varied, we do not make a general statement about e.g. patterns of idle times that would apply to all of them. The power states in our experiments correspond to the sleep, stand-by, idle and active states of an IBM mobile hard-drive.\n",

    "comment": "You are right that our paper views the DPM problem mostly from an online algorithms perspective, abstracting away the question of how to generate these predictions. There do exist techniques in the literature to learn such predictions (we reference some in line 51 and lines 160-162), which were designed with the idea of simply following/trusting these predictions without accounting for prediction error/robustness. One way our paper may stimulate ML research on the side of generating these predictions is that since our performance guarantee is in terms of the $\\ell_1$ error of predictions, it suggests this as a clear and simple loss function for learning these predictions.\n\nFor the final version of our paper, we will also include our additional experiments with real-world data where we actually learn predictions from past data. See our reply to reviewer LdW3 for details.\n\nThank you also for the link to the paper of Helmbold et al. on disk spin-down! We didn\u2019t know about this paper, and we will cite it as additional related work. Interestingly, it uses the Share Update algorithm that we already mention in our paper as an alternative to the method of Blum and Burch. The empirical results of Helmbold et al. in fact inspired us to use Share Update for generating predictions in the additional experiments.\n",

    "submission_title": "Dynamic Analysis of Higher-Order Coordination in Neuronal Assemblies via De-Sparsified Orthogonal Matching Pursuit",
    "review": "In general, the authors presented a novel approach for analyzing higher-order interactions in a neuron ensemble. The simulation results suggested that the algorithm successfully identify the endogenous components of higher-order coordinated spikes. In application of real neuron ensemble, the algorithm identified brain state modulated higher-order interactions. The paper was well written, and the experiments were carefully designed to demonstrated the power of the current algorithm. However, I would concern about the scope of application of this model. First, the anesthesia data has relatively simple structure, that single factor (anesthesia) generated large effects on neuron spiking rates. And the authors only tested the model on eight neurons with the highest spiking rate from the ensemble. It is unclear whether the model would converge for a data set with more complication structure and lower spiking rate. Second, the identified higher-order interactions and the history-dependence did not readily interpretable, as the modeling components that generated this knowledge did not have a biology meaning. In many real-world applications, users would not be able to tell whether identified higher-order interactions and history dependence were real or meaningful. ",
    "comment": "- **(Regarding effects of spiking rates and complexity of latent dynamics):** We agree with the reviewer that these are important considerations for applying our proposed analyses. We note that the eight neurons analyzed during anesthesia had a low average firing rate of 0.0547 spikes/bin (equivalently, 1.0941 Hz). In contrast, our simulated neuronal ensemble had an average firing rate of 0.0972 spikes/bin. The text will be revised to emphasize that the effects of average spiking rate have been considered. We will add an additional supplementary simulation with more complex latent dynamics and a larger ensemble size for concreteness.\n- **(Regarding interpretability):** Thank you for identifying the interpretation of our analyses as a point for clarification. As the reviewer suggested, our generative model is not biological. It is closely related to the maximum entropy model (note Equation 4 near line 102), which is inspired by statistical physics, and makes minimal assumptions about the underlying interactions to capture time-varying coordinated activity in an ensemble of spiking neurons. The identified higher-order coordination, however, can provide biological hypotheses on the circuit mechanisms involved. For instance, the dynamics of the higher-order coordination observed in the history-dependent analysis of the anesthesia data suggests the involvement of an exogenous (i.e. non-cortical) process in spiking coordination.

    "review": "It took me a while to understand the contributions made in this paper, but I think they can be summarized as extending the multinomial GLM model of Ba et al. (2014, Frontiers in Comp Neuro) to have time-varying parameters. This extension leans heavily on methods described in Sheikhattar et al. (2015, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing). The goal of this new model is to capture higher-order spike time correlations between simultaneously recorded neurons. The new method does not require repeated trials.\n\nMy biggest concern with this paper is the difficulty I had in understanding the motivations behind various modeling choices and implementation details. I feel like I only began to understand this paper after reading Ba et al. (2014) and Sheikhattar et al. (2015) in careful detail.\n\nFor example, a window length W and a forgetting factor \\beta control how quickly the model parameters vary over time. If the forgetting factor is close to zero and the window lengths are relatively small, then the parameters can vary rapidly, potentially resulting in overfitting -- how is this avoided? If the forgetting factor is close to one, then the parameters vary only very slowly, potentially resulting in an underfit model. Even if the forgetting factor is well tuned, this model can capture a gradual drift in parameters, but potentially it will have trouble accounting for rare, step-like changes in network state, as happens during propofol induced loss of consciousness (investigated in Fig 3). The paper would be stronger if the dynamics of the time-varying parameters were more clearly discussed and illustrated in practice.\n\nThe assumption of sparsity on the GLM parameters is not clearly motivated or discussed. Why not use l2 regularization instead of greedy sparse estimates? The Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm is not reviewed, and terms like \"support set\" (refering to the subset of nonzero parameters) are used without a clear definition. On lines 171-172 the authors say they apply a Kalman forward filter and backward smoother control \"abrupt variations\" but the details of this smoothing are not present in the main or supplemental text.\n\nThe application of the model to real data is discussed only in a short section (5.2). How were the \\beta parameters selected in this analysis? How much sparsity was imposed on the parameter estimates, and how was this tuned?\n\nDespite these misgivings, I think the model addresses an interesting topic and I am open to raising my score if the other reviewers were better able to understand the details of the model.\n\n\nOther Comments\n--------------\n\n- On line 318 there is a typo, \"estimate\" should be \"estimated\"\n\n- In figures 2 + 3, please label the blue-to-red colorbar\n\n- On lines 167-169, are the \"u\" variables meant to be \"\\mu\"?",
    "comment": "- **(Regarding model fit vs. hyperparameters $W$ and $\\beta$ ):** We agree with the reviewer on the merits of clearly address hyperparameter selection and goodness of fit. We will include supplementary simulations that address the expected effects of varying window length and the forgetting factor. These will include quantitative measures of model goodness of fit. Invoking the multivariate extension of the point process time-rescaling theorem, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is used to compare rescaled empirical interspike intervals -- of each mark event -- to uniform quantiles. Additionally, the autocorrelation function (ACF) is used to test if rescaled interspike intervals are uncorrelated. Representative examples of the KS and ACF tests for multiple marks will be included in the revision.\n- **(Regarding motivations for greedy sparse model estimation):** We will revise the text so that our justification for imposing sparsity on mGLM parameters through the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit is clearer. In brief, the motivation was two-fold. \n    - First, network interactions based on past ensemble spiking history are hypothesized to be sparse, as supported by several empirical and theoretical studies that we will be sure to reference in our revision. Hence, a history-dependent model of coordinated ensemble spiking events should account for this sparsity. \n    - Second, optimizing over all model parameters (as would be the case for regularized optimization) becomes intractable as the number of neurons analyzed increases. Greedy approaches mitigate this issue by optimizing over a small subset of these parameters (i.e. the support set, which is defined as the subset of non-zero parameters). The Orthogonal Matching Pursuit identifies the support set iteratively rather than it being fixed beforehand. As such, if the true model turns out to be dense, the OMP procedure will select a large support set (via cross-validation) and adapts to the dense support of the parameters. As recommended by Reviewer 1, we will include a preliminary discussion of mathematical notation and nomenclature in which we will explicitly define the relevant terminology.\n- **(Regarding details of Kalman F/B smoothing):** Thank you for this recommendation; we will include the motivation for and details of the forward/backward smoothing algorithm in supplemental text.\n- **(Regarding hyperparameters for real-data analysis):** The parameter $\\beta$ was selected based on the \"effective\" integration window length given by $W/(1 - \\beta)$, as established by Sheikhattar et al. (2015). For the selected values of $W$ and $\\beta$, this ratio corresponded to a 100 second window; this selection enabled us to capture the effects of slow oscillations ($\\sim$ 0.1 Hz) over multiple periods while still permitting the tracking of transitions between brain states. We cross-validated for the size of the support set that maximized the static log-likelihood, thereby assuming the sparsity to be constant for simplicity. We will provide more details about the choice of $\\beta$ and cross-validation procedure for choosing the sparsity of the mGLM parameters.\n- **(Regarding typos and figure colorbars):** Thank you for pointing out these errors. We will correct the typo and amend the figure.\n- **(Regarding notation on lines 167-169):** Thank you for pointing out this lack of clarity -- the variables are correctly referenced in the text, but we will revise the text so that these quantities are more clearly defined in a preliminary subsection on notation. The variables \"$u$\" are the modulations of the mark CIFs, and stand for the argument of the logistic function as defined on line 158. For the null hypothesis, \"$u\\_{0}$\" is computed from the CIFs of the spiking processes rather than the inverse logistic function.",

    "review": "* This paper gives a comprehensive set of tools to study higher order interactions. The tools would be very valuable for computational neuroscience audience. Most of my comments are about making some practical/application aspects clearer in the text. \n\n* While there are no apparent inaccuracies in the text, but the main bulk of paper is heavy in mathematical symbols and equations. Improving the writing could greatly improve the readership and appeal.  Defining the notations in a separate subsection in beginning, and stating all the modeling assumptions (time-varying models, sparsity assumptions, smoothening steps) at same place would help. \n\n* Review of previous works that use marked point process tools for neural activity is missing. \n\n*  For modeling time history dependance, the authors switch from $n^*_t$ (marked representation) to $n_t$  (original neural activity) for computational tractability. This should be explained more carefully since it might have significant implications on results / interpretation. \n\n* How sensitive are measures/models to timing jitter? Small timing changes in individual spikes could change the assigned mark. For example, for two neurons and two nearby time bins, an observation of [(0, 0), (1, 1)] could easily become [(1, 0), (0, 1)] by moving the first neuron's spike ahead in time slightly. Since the mapping from actual spike train to marked point process is highly non-linear, this could significantly affect results of the methods.\n\n* While the presented method gives a statistical test to test if there is rth order interaction in a population of C neurons, it does not identify which neurons are interacting. Repeating the test on all subsets of $r$ neurons might not be ideal. Expanding the discussion around this issue would clarify the application for neuroscientific questions. \n\n* How do the empirical results (especially on human data) change with the smoothening parameter $\\beta$ ? Showing dependance on/robustness to $\\beta$ would help understand the time-varying model better. \n\n* In general, since the approach uses a time-varying model, the methods presented in the paper do not identify higher order effects that occur at very slow time scales. For example, for the data in Figure 2, considering very large time scales (large $W$ or $\\beta$ ~ 1) would show significant r=2 order interaction for the whole duration of experiment. Choice of these hyper-paramters is important for practical application and should be mentioned in text.\n\n* Large differences between history-dependent and independent models is revealing, suggesting that large order interactions in simple models can be attributed to simple mechanisms in slightly more complex models. This is explained in main text associated with Figure 2. However, making these analyses clearer would help with a broader readership, who want to apply these tools to data. \n",
    "comment": "- **(Regarding a preliminary subsection for notation and assumptions):** Thank you for the suggestion; we will revise the text accordingly to clarify mathematical notations and modeling assumptions.\n- **(Regarding background of marked point processes for neural activity):** We are happy to include a review of prior applications of marked point process models for neural activity.\n- **(Regarding modeling history dependence in terms of original neural activity):** Our revised text will more carefully motivate the change of notation. Since $ n\\_{t} $ can be derived from $ n^{\\*}\\_{t} $ by a one-to-one linear mapping, there is an equivalence between history parameterizations based on $ n\\_{t} $ and on $ n^{\\*}\\_{t} $. The parameterization based on $n_{t}$ is not only more tractable, but more interpretable in the sense that the dependence on past states of ensemble activity is captured in terms of spiking responses rather than indicator vectors.\n- **(Regarding robustness to timing jitter):** We agree with the reviewer that timing jitter is a key consideration in modeling spiking data as Bernoulli-like observations. The proposed methods' robustness to jitter comes from modeling only the reliable interactions. Marks with few events are indeed susceptible to the artifacts described by the reviewer, but these marks occur unreliably and are thus excluded from analysis.\n- **(Regarding tests of $r^{th}$-order interactions):** Thank you for pointing out this lack of clarity -- we tested simultaneously for all sets of $r^{th}$-order interactions, not single subsets of $r$ neurons. We will ensure the revised text reflects this more clearly.\n- **(Regarding hyperparameters $W$ and $\\beta$ ):** We are happy to include supplementary simulations to show the expected effects of varying $W$ and $\\beta$. As Reviewer 2 has also suggested, these will include quantitative measures of model goodness of fit. The choice of hyperparameters for our main results will be added to the main text to complement the figure legends.\n- **(Regarding clarification of comparisons between history-dependent and independent models):** Thank you for your suggestion. We will clarify these analyses so that they are more accessible to a broader readership.",

Technical contributions.** We would like to restate that simplicity is one of our goals, and our careful redesign of core modules in the popular STM framework is instrumental to future works in this direction. With our to-be-released open-source code, we believe the new and deep insight with our solid technical STCN contribution and exhaustive experimentation should be of sufficient impact to NeurIPS and future VOS research.\n\n**2\\. Dot product with L2 normalization.** True. From an optimization perspective, L2 similarity would be the same as dot product when L2 normalization is enabled (with the normalization discarding one degree of freedom). However, L2 normalization is not trivially learnable via gradient descent as demonstrated by the empirical gap in performance. ",

    "comment": "Thank you for the detailed review and questions. We will address the questions one by one:\n\n**1. Results on memory management.** We find that the change of optimal memory scheduling is related to both STCN and L2 similarity (full results tabulated below). We will add relevant discussion in the main paper.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1.1\\.** With STM, there is a significant performance drop when the temporary frame is not used regardless of the similarity function. This supports our claim that STM requires close-range relations for robust matching\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1.2\\.** With STCN+dot product, the performance drop is slight. Note that by dropping the temporary frame, we also enjoy a 31% increase in FPS as shown in the main paper. This supports that the STCN architecture provides more robust key features.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1.3\\.** With STCN+L2 similarity, it performs the best when the temporary frame is not used (while also enjoying the 31% speed improvement). This suggests L2 similarity is more susceptible to drifting (L150) when the memory scheduling is not carefully designed. Overall, L2 similarity is still beneficial.\n\n*Performance of networks under different memory scheduling strategies:*\n\n|                      | Every 5th + last frame | Every 5th only |\n|----------------------|:----------------------:|:--------------:|\n| STM + Dot product    |          83.3          |      81.3      |\n| STM + L2 similarity  |          82.7          |      81.0      |\n| STCN + Dot product   |          84.3          |      84.1      |\n| STCN + L2 similarity |          83.1          |      85.4      |\n\n**2. Results with only the last frame as memory.** We would expect the model to perform a lot worse as it cannot adapt to object disappearance or utilize rich features in a large memory bank. We do notice significant drifting in this case and our performance would drop to 73.4.\n\n**3. The background matching explanation.** Thank you for the question. We will clarify in the main paper with the following ideas:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **3.1\\.** Unlike explicit foreground/background separation as in [9], we never distinguish foreground/background pixels in the correspondence stage -- we aim to match all of them, regardless of their semantic identities. Explicit separation would unavoidably create biases for foreground/background, in contrast to our holistic approach.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **3.2\\.** We believe STCN does not spread attention to foreground pixels any more than STM does for two reasons: 1) STCN focuses on a more diverse use of the memory (which is beneficial according to our experiments), not of the query (which might spread the attention as you suggested), and 2) STM also fails in most of the failure cases that we have presented.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **3.3\\.** We perform a simple experiment to perform mask tracking on the background (floor, lake, etc.) and find that the results are pretty accurate -- suggesting that STCN has the ability to perform background matching.\n",

It would be better to visualize with real examples.\n\n- In Fig.4, the numbers of total nodes for Dot product and L2 similarity are different. Shouldn't they be the same?\n\n- Are the results in Tab.1 both based on L2 similarity? If not, this should be clarified. Also, it would be better to report performance for STM with L2 similarity.\n\n- I noticed that all the experiments are conducted on the validation sets. It would be better to incorporate results on testing sets into the paper.  From the Tab-1 supplementary, I noticed that the ''ours''  model actually performs worse than the previous method on the test-dev of DAVIS17.

    "comment": "Thank you for the detailed review and questions. We will address the questions one by one:\n\n**1\\. Intuition for L2, and dot-product with softmax.** Thank you for the suggestion. We would like to emphasize that softmax will tend to *amplify* the uneven similarities instead of smoothing them due to the exponentiation (except when even the most dominant affinities are very small in magnitude --  but that almost never happens in STM/STCN). For example, initial similarities of [1, 4, 1] (max is 4 times the min) will become [0.045, 0.909, 0.045] (max is 20 times the min) after softmax. A similar phenomenon will occur when the affinities are negative.\n\n**2\\. Real examples.** We use the 2D illustrative example to give a clean and easily understood visualization. Real data would be too high-dimensional (64 dimensions), with projection likely discarding too much information for the purpose of demonstration. On the other hand, we actually have provided statistical analysis of **real data** in Figure 4 and in the corresponding paragraph (L231-L242).\n\n**3\\. Number of nodes in Figure 4.** The number of nodes are in fact the same. The plot for dot product drops quickly (those representing totally unused nodes) which is explained in the left paragraph (L231-L242).\n\n**4\\. Results in Table 1.** Both STCN and STM reported in Table 1 use L2 similarity in the spirit of control experiment, changing one variable at a time. Using dot product for STM would not change our conclusion in Table 1 (details given in the table below).\n\n|                      | Every 5th + last frame | Every 5th only |\n|----------------------|:----------------------:|:--------------:|\n| STM + Dot product    |          83.3          |      81.3      |\n| STCN + Dot product (shown in Table 1)  |          84.3          |      84.1      |\n| STCN + L2 similarity (shown in Table 1) |          83.1          |      85.4      |\n\n**5\\. Val vs. test set.** Note that the YouTubeVOS validation set is both large-scale (474 videos) and closed-sourced (we have **no access to the ground-truth**), and is thus a trustworthy benchmark on which we have achieved excellent results. The DAVIS test-dev set, as mentioned on L27-L32 of the supplementary material, is much more challenging with cases like harsh lighting conditions and highly similar objects. Methods that employ hand-crafted locality control (which we do not) would be more robust to this unforeseen distribution change. STM also suffers a large performance drop from validation to test-dev (81.8->72.2). In spite of that, Our method already performs competitively without changes, and performs the best with only a small change while still running pretty fast.\n\n**6\\. Missing citation.** Thanks.

    "review": "Overall, the paper is well written and there are no major issues. The proposed approach seems novel, and achieves strong VOS performance when compared with previous SOTA methods. Furthermore, the major claims made by the work are supported by experiments or ablations. There are some questions/issues (see below), so I suggest this work is *marginally above the acceptance threshold* until these are addressed.\n\n## Questions/Issues\n\n1. A recent paper [1] has a similar network architecture, where the correspondence/affinity between pixels is computed separate from the value/query. Although the specific problems on which the networks are applied are different - [1] attempts to perform VOS while training in an unsupervised manner, whereas this work perform the traditional semi-supervised setting - can the authors comment  on the differences between the two approaches? Some discussion differentiating the two methods/architectures would help highlight the novelty of this approach.\n\n2. Table 2 shows that L2 leads to better results on STCN than dot-product and cosine similarity. Is this, however, specific to the STCN, or would replacing the dot-product in another network, e.g. STM, lead to a similar performance improvement?\n\n3. Table 1 uses dot-product for STM and L2 Similarity for the STCN. Would the drop in performance when using the last frames (results in col 3 and col 4) be found when using the dot-product with STCN? Is this specific to the STCN or the L2 Similarity? An ablation exploring this would be beneficial to better understand the strengths/weaknesses of the proposed approach.\n\n## Minor Questions/Comments\n\n1. Is the use of Resnet+CBAM layers to combine query+values (line 117) necessary for strong performance?\n\n2. How would the light value encoder differ from resizing the binary segmentation mask and using the resized mask as $v^M$?\n\n3. It would be useful to see scores when not using static image pretraining, so that the method could be compared with other methods that do not use such data (i.e. only training on Youtube-VOS).\n\n[1] Lai, Z., Lu, E., & Xie, W.

    "comment": "Thank you for the detailed review and questions. We will address the questions one by one:\n\n**1\\.** **Comparison with MAST.** Our network is different from MAST in two important aspects: motivation (which comes from the fact that we are doing different tasks as you mentioned) and the use of a value encoder.  \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1.1\\.** For self-supervised learning as in MAST, they only utilize RGB images as they do not have access to other inputs. Hence an encoder that takes only RGB is a necessity. In STCN, we deliberately take away the mask input with clearly motivated rationales (L99-L103), and establish empirically that it is a better choice instead of a concession.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1.2\\.** We utilize a value encoder to generate deep features for the mask, while MAST simply downsamples the mask in test-time. Our method makes it more robust to accumulation error, as object features are re-encoded every frame instead of just linearly combining previous masks. With more expressive deep features, we can also use a larger image stride in matching (we use 16, while MAST uses 4) -- our full affinity matrix would therefore be $4^4=256$ times smaller than that of MAST (neglecting the memory-saving engineering extension in MAST that we could also employ in principle).\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1.3\\.** We will add relevant discussion in the paper.\n\n**2\\.** **STM with L2 similarity.** Thank you for this interesting question. STCN and L2 similarity should be taken holistically -- our rationale and intuition for L2 similarity in Section 4 are based on STCN. Notably, the memory/query keys are in the same embedding space in STCN while not in STM. We find that STM performs slightly worse when L2 similarity is used instead of dot product (83.3 -> 82.7 J&F), with dot product using twice the number of channels to perform well as suggested by Table 2. We will add this observation in the paper.\n\n**3\\.** **Memory scheduling with dot product.** We find that the change of optimal memory scheduling is related to both STCN and L2 similarity (full results tabulated below). We will add relevant discussion in the main paper.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **3.1\\.** With STM, there is a significant performance drop when the temporary frame is not used regardless of the similarity function. This supports our claim that STM requires close-range relations for robust matching\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **3.2\\.** With STCN+dot product, the performance drop is slight. Note that by dropping the temporary frame, we also enjoy a 31% increase in FPS as shown in the main paper. This supports that the STCN architecture provides more robust key features.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **3.3\\.** With STCN+L2 similarity, it performs the best when the temporary frame is not used (while also enjoying the 31% speed improvement). This suggests L2 similarity is more susceptible to drifting (L150) when the memory scheduling is not carefully designed. Overall, L2 similarity is still beneficial.\n\n*Performance of networks under different memory scheduling strategies:*\n\n|                      | Every 5th + last frame | Every 5th only |\n|----------------------|:----------------------:|:--------------:|\n| STM + Dot product    |          83.3          |      81.3      |\n| STM + L2 similarity  |          82.7          |      81.0      |\n| STCN + Dot product   |          84.3          |      84.1      |\n| STCN + L2 similarity |          83.1          |      85.4      |\n\n**4\\.** **Necessity of CBAM.** In a later experiment, we find that CBAM accelerates convergence but is not necessary for the final performance. With longer training, the performance is the same with/without CBAM.\n\n**5\\.** **Giving up the value encoder.** It performs significantly worse. See also point 1.2.\n\n**6\\.** **Without static image pretraining.** Many related works like STM [17], KMN [21], RMNet [25], MiVOS [20], GraphMem [15], etc. already employ static image pretraining. We believe using sufficient data encourages more expressive and powerful models that can infer patterns from data instead of relying on hand-crafted mechanisms. Notwithstanding, we can also provide results without pretraining in the main paper for reference.",

    "comment": "**Q: Reformulation that modifying the binary importance vector y as having a float value to become PageRank vector v is incremental**\n\nAlthough we show that our formulation and the formulation in [66,67] are related, there is a fundamental difference between the two. [66,67] look at the graph of images, where the relation between images is inferred from their proposals. In their case, object discovery is formulated as **a discrete optimization problem**. On the other hand, we consider a weighted graph of proposals across all images (no image constraint) and solve **an eigenvector problem** on its weight matrix to find objects. This change proves to be valuable as it allows us to scale up to 1.7M images (87 times larger than [67]) and outperform the state-of-the-art methods on medium-size datasets by up to 32% in Average Precision (AP). \n  \n**Q: A more explanation is needed on how this method can be processed in parallel and why other methods can not. P matrix computed on the large-scale dataset must be very large. How can this matrix be divided into multiple chunks?**\n\nOur method consists of three steps: proposal generation, feature extraction and optimization. Since the first two steps are done separately on each image, they can be easily parallelized. The key innovation that we propose is the optimization step, which is formulated as finding the leading eigenvector of a big matrix. We use a simple implementation of the power iteration algorithm [68] which consists only of matrix-vector multiplications and can be parallelized. We describe it in Algorithm 1 in the supplemental material. We present briefly here how we build chunks of matrix $W$. The matrix $P$ used in PageRank is derived from $W$ and is processed similarly. As presented in Section 3.1, $W$ is an $n \\times n$ block matrix where the block at row $p$ and column $q$ contains the similarity $S_{pq}$ between regions in images $p$ and $q$. The $i$-th chunk $W_i$ of $W$ consists of $l_i$ consecutive rows of blocks from $bb_i$ to $eb_i$ (begin block  and end block) which correspond to consecutive rows of $W$ with indices from $br_i$ to $er_i$ (begin row and end row), respectively. As a result, $W_i$ has size $(er_i-br_i+1) \\times N$ where $N$ is the total number of regions in the image collection. To build $W_i$, we simply compute in parallel the similarity $S_{pq}$ with $bb_i \\leq p \\leq eb_i$ and assemble them into their position in $W_i$. We explain why [66,67] cannot be parallelized below.\n\n**Q: In L112, what does it mean \"inherently sequential\" for other baselines?**\n\n[66,67] formulate object discovery as a discrete optimization problem (C) and solve it by block coordinate ascent, iteratively alternating between the optimization of variables $x$ and $e$, while the variables $x_i$ are optimized sequentially. The precise steps of this alternative algorithm are detailed in Section 2.5 in [66].  Concretely, in each iteration of optimizing $x$, an index $i$ is chosen and $x_i$ is updated while $e$ and all $x_j$ with $j \\neq i$ are kept fixed. The update of $x_i$ depends on the updated values of other $x_j$ if $x_j$ is updated before $x_i$. This is crucial to guarantee that the objective always increases. If all $x_i$ are updated in parallel, there is no guarantee that the objective would increase. This process therefore cannot be parallelized and the optimization of [66,67] is sequential by nature. These points will be clarified.",

Object discovery in image collection is indeed a very relevant problem, as we are slowly approaching the limits of the supervised learning paradigm. Nowadays, image data is abundant; therefore, I see the contribution of methods that can scale well to very large datasets as very valuable to our community. \n* In general, I find that the technical contribution of this paper stands on very solid ground: I love the insight that the formulation by [Vo et al., CVPR\u201919] can be re-interpreted as a ranking problem over a fully-connected graph of proposals and establishing the link to well-understood and mature methodology for link analysis. \n* The implications of this insight are important and will allow performing object discovery on (abundant) large-scale unlabelled photo collections. The contribution is orthogonal to (from my side anticipated) future efforts in unsupervised object-centric representation learning. \n* The paper presents solid experimental analysis on COCO dataset (and subsets), as well as the large-scale OpenImage dataset. Analysis shows that the only competitive method [Vo et al., ECCV\u201920] is not applicable to OpenImages (I do have some criticism on this point, though- see the weaknesses section). I also appreciate the detailed discussion on the impact of different object proposals and features (ImageNet-supervised and self-supervised), and the comparison between three variants of this ranking formulation. \n* Besides parallelization, it is also very nice that this formulation is scalable enough that it doesn\u2019t need to limit the number of object proposals per image, which I assume is the main reason behind slightly better performance compared to [Vo et al., ECCV\u201920]. At the same time, I would also like to note that it would be nice to discuss this experimentally. \n\n\nCons\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n* The most problematic aspect of this paper is the very vague definition of what \u201cother top-performing methods cannot handle\u201d (Tab 1.). This is further related to Sec. 4.1, run time discussion, which states that \u201c[32] and [67] did not finish in reasonable time\u201d. What is considered to be a reasonable time? One week (par. \u201cQuantitative evaluation\u201d mentions that)? For example, training neural networks can easily take one week or more, and if a method needs more than a week (2 weeks?) to finish, I would not say that it is not applicable to such a large dataset. I understand that one cannot wait for the optimization to converge for months, but I am really in the dark here what kind of time spans we are talking about, and I would like to see a discussion on this (also the final version of the paper must be more precise here). Also, let me remark here that \u201creasonable time\u201d will be different in the future with better compute (although it is true that datasets will be growing as well). \n* It can be seen that optimization-based methods scale linearly (i.e., scale very well). Therefore we can also expect that these methods should be very applicable in the future. I definitely see that the major advantage of the proposed method due to the fact that it is nicely parallelizable, but this aspect is related to the core contribution of this paper. Finally, I do not understand why EB runtime is constant? It should be linear wrt. the number of images (when processed serially), or else I dramatically misunderstood something. \n* This might be no an issue with this paper per se, but more general- is AP the right metric for this? In my opinion, it isn\u2019t because object discovery is not well-defined (part vs. whole object ambiguity), and therefore, every (possibly relevant) discovered region that is not labeled would be considered as FP and penalize the performance. Using incorrect metrics may hinder progress in this field. Why not evaluating (average) recall wrt. pre-fixed proposal thresholds instead? \n* This is also a more general comment: object discovery formulation, as tackled in this paper (and formalized by Vo et al., CVPR\u201919), is inherently about finding commonly occurring patterns in the image collection. Wrt. the long-tailed distribution of object classes, this will only be applicable to the \u201chead\u201d classes and will dismiss the tail. I am not saying that methods tackling the discovery of frequently occurring objects/patterns are not valuable, but I believe that this venue explicitly encourages discussion of limitations, and this is certainly one of them! \n\n\n\nJustification\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI think this paper presents a nice contribution for scalable optimization-based object discovery.

At the same time, I would also like to note that it would be nice to discuss this experimentally.**\n\nThank you for pointing this out. It is true that, unlike [67], we are able to use almost all the regions produced by the proposal algorithm (2000 regions per image at most) thanks to the good scalability of our formulation. On average, we have 814 and 850 regions per image on C20K and Op50K, respectively.  We have now evaluated LOD on C20K and Op50K using different numbers of proposals and observed that its performance improves with additional region proposals, notably in the multi-object setting. When a subset of only 100 regions is used, the average precision (AP50) of LOD matches the top performance of [67], and increases with more regions (the full results are shown in the table below). This observation partly explains our better performance compared to [67] (which places a limit on the number of regions for computational reasons) and the benefit of using all region proposals.\n\n| # regions || C20K ||| Op50K ||\n|:--------:|:------:|:----:|:----------:|:------:|:----:|:----------:|\n|           | CorLoc | AP50 | AP@[50:95] | CorLoc | AP50 | AP@[50:95] |\n|     50    |  40.9  |  4.5 |    1.22    |  42.0  | 4.55 |    1.31    |\n|    100    |  44.0  | 5.38 |    1.47    |  43.4  |  5.1 |     1.4    |\n|    200    |  46.5  | 6.13 |    1.71    |  45.6  | 5.83 |    1.61    |\n|    400    |  48.0  |  6.6 |    1.91    |  47.1  | 6.32 |    1.77    |\n|    All    |  48.5  | 6.63 |    1.98    |  48.1  | 6.46 |    1.88    |\n\n**Q: The most problematic aspect of this paper is the very vague definition of what \u201cother top-performing methods cannot handle\u201d (Tab 1.).

Also, let me remark here that \u201creasonable time\u201d will be different in the future with better compute (although it is true that datasets will be growing as well).**\n\nIn our experiments, we ran all methods for up to one week (the time limit for a sequential job on our server). After a week, we observed that [67] finished about 18\\% of its computation. We agree that it would be important to report more precise times, and will add full timings and results to the final version of the paper if it is accepted. \n\n**Q: It can be seen that optimization-based methods scale linearly (i.e., scale very well). Therefore we can also expect that these methods should be very applicable in the future. I definitely see that the major advantage of the proposed method due to the fact that it is nicely parallelizable, but this aspect is related to the core contribution of this paper. Finally, I do not understand why EB runtime is constant? It should be linear wrt. the number of images (when processed serially), or else I dramatically misunderstood something.**\n\n\nWe agree that the optimization-based methods will continue to be applicable and we hope that our exploration into their performance will spur development of other efficient solutions. \n\nIt is true that the run time of EB is linear in the number of images, but since processing a single image takes only 1.3s when processed sequentially, its run time is very small compared to the other methods. Therefore, the graph in Figure 2 appears flat for EB. We will clarify this. \n\n**Q: This might be no an issue with this paper per se, but more general- is AP the right metric for this? In my opinion, it isn\u2019t because object discovery is not well-defined (part vs. whole object ambiguity), and therefore, every (possibly relevant) discovered region that is not labeled would be considered as FP and penalize the performance. Using incorrect metrics may hinder progress in this field. Why not evaluating (average) recall wrt. pre-fixed proposal thresholds instead?**\n\n\nFinding the right metric to assess multi-object discovery is a complex issue. The CorLoc metric used in single-object discovery, i.e., the precision when only one region is selected per image, is not appropriate in this context. We use Average Precision (AP), a popular metric for object detection, in the multi-object discovery evaluation to avoid the dependence on the number $m$ of selected regions per image, unlike [67] which computes recall at a fixed value of $m$. We acknowledge that the definition of AP given in our submission is vague and may be misleading. To be more precise, the notion of AP used in all our experiments is correctly defined as the area under the precision-recall curve where precision and recall are computed for each value of $m$ from 1 to $M$ (the maximum number of ground-truth objects per image). As such, this metric accounts for both precision and recall.\n\nDue to the lack of dedicated datasets for object discovery, we evaluate our approach on popular benchmarks for object detection. As pointed out by the reviewer, this protocol is not ideal as there may exist many unlabelled objects that are returned but considered false positives (see Figure 3 for sample examples). Object discovery remains a challenging problem and we hope that our work encourages further research, including new dedicated datasets. \n\n\n**Q: This is also a more general comment: object discovery formulation, as tackled in this paper (and formalized by Vo et al., CVPR\u201919), is inherently about finding commonly occurring patterns in the image collection. Wrt. the long-tailed distribution of object classes, this will only be applicable to the \u201chead\u201d classes and will dismiss the tail. I am not saying that methods tackling the discovery of frequently occurring objects/patterns are not valuable, but I believe that this venue explicitly encourages discussion of limitations, and this is certainly one of them!**\n\nIt is true that, by definition, both the optimization-based existing object discovery methods and the proposed technique are biased toward the frequently occurring patterns and objects. However, we have observed little correlation between LOD\u2019s performance on an object class and the class appearance frequency (corr = -0.09, see figure at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAPv4IJa-CUJqF2fMaOCpAVM8M_onsUJ/view?usp=sharing). It could be due to the fact that even though we rank all regions in the image collection at once, we choose objects (based on the ranking) from each image separately. Thus, objects are returned if they stand out and are better connected than other regions in the same image, even if they are objects of a rare class. On the other hand, we have observed that finding small objects is more challenging than finding bigger ones. LOD\u2019s performance on a class correlates well (corr = 0.76) with the average object size (relative to the image size), and the same phenomenon has been observed with supervised object detectors.  We will add a more thorough discussion of limitations to the paper.\n",

    "comment": "**Q: The paper lacks motivations/discussions of the proposed technology, making it hard to follow why a mathematical method is employed in the framework. Adding intuitive discussions about why ranking is a good technical solution for object discovery would improve the quality of the paper.**\n\nAs discussed in Section 2.1, it is natural to cast unsupervised object discovery (UOD) as the task of finding repetitive visual patterns in image collections (what other notion of \u201cobject\u201d would be available without any supervision?). Recent approaches (e.g., [66,67]) to UOD formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem, with the corresponding computational limitations. The motivation behind our work is to formulate UOD as a simpler graph-theoretical problem with a more efficient solution, where objects correspond to well-connected nodes in a graph whose nodes are region proposals (instead of images in [66,67]), and edges are weighted by region similarity and objectness. In this scenario, finding object-proposal nodes is now a ranking problem where the goal is to rank the nodes based on whether they represent objects. Another work with a similar motivation that uses ranking (of images) is VisualRank [27], where an image search problem is solved by applying PageRank to the pairwise similarity matrix in an image collection.\n\nFrom another perspective, given a set of region proposals an image, discovering objects means finding the most object-like regions. This naturally amounts to ranking them according to their ``objectness\u2019\u2019. In fact, [66,67] implicitly rank regions in each image by assigning them a binary score ($x_{ij}$). Different from them, we rank all regions in the image collection by assigning them positive real scores. We show that this relaxation allows more effective and scalable solutions to UOD. We will clarify these points in the paper if it is accepted.\n\n**Q: Graph connection density is definitely an implication about the frequently appearing objects. However, it corresponds to discovering the frequent objects. The paper could add more discussion about whether the technology is a good fit for the task of object discovery which looks to discover single/all foreground objects.**\n\nSimilar to VisualRank [27], we assume that a high similarity score between a pair of proposals is an indicator of whether the corresponding two proposals may correspond to a common foreground object. We use the PHM algorithm to compute the similarity score in our work. PHM is a probabilistic algorithm that uses a voting procedure among the pairs of regions, and given that regions are concentrated in foreground areas, the resulting similarity matrix favors discovering foreground objects. This enables our ranking formulations to find visual patterns that are both repetitive and object-like. Further discussion of PHM can be found in [8]. \n\n\n**Q: I wonder whether performing ranking based on object proposal similarity with other regions in the dataset leads to an ill configuration of the unsupervised object detection problem. It encourages discovery of frequently appearing objects, when suppressing objects rarely appear. It would be great if the paper could provide the performance over object categories with different instance numbers, respectively.**\n\nIt is true that, by definition, both the existing optimization-based object discovery methods and the proposed technique are biased toward frequently occurring patterns and objects. However, we have computed LOD\u2019s performance by object category on C20K dataset and observed little correlation between the performance on an object class and its appearance frequency (the corresponding correlation is only -0.09, see figure at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAPv4IJa-CUJqF2fMaOCpAVM8M_onsUJ/view?usp=sharing). A possible explanation is that even though we rank all regions in the image collection at once, we choose objects (based on the ranking) from each image separately. Therefore, regions can be selected as objects if they stand out more from the background and are better connected in the graph than other regions in the same image, even if they represent objects of a rare class. On the other hand, we have observed that finding small objects is more challenging than finding bigger ones and the performance of LOD on a class correlates well (correlation score of  0.76) with average object size (relative to the image size). This is not surprising as the same phenomenon has been observed with supervised object detectors. As suggested by the reviewer, we will add this discussion to the paper.",

    "comment": "**Q: Why should the overall idea of link-analysis/ranking by 'authority/hubs' idea, behind the particular objective and their particular algorithms, substantially help for this problem?**\n\nAs discussed in Section 2.1, it is natural to cast unsupervised object discovery (UOD) as the task of finding repetitive visual patterns in image collections (what other notion of \u201cobject\u201d would be available without any supervision?). Recent approaches (e.g., [66,67]) to UOD formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem, with the corresponding computational limitations. The motivation behind our work is to formulate UOD as a simpler graph-theoretical problem with a more efficient solution, where objects correspond to well-connected nodes in a graph whose nodes are region proposals (instead of images in [66,67]), and edges are weighted by region similarity and objectness. In this scenario, finding object-proposal nodes is now a ranking problem where the goal is to rank the nodes based on whether they represent objects. Another work with a similar motivation that uses ranking (of images) is VisualRank [27], where an image search problem is solved by applying PageRank to the pairwise similarity matrix in an image collection.   \n\nThe ranking formulation leads to very efficient solutions from link analysis, including the quadratic formulation (Q) and Pagerank. This allows us to use all the proposals, instead of a subset as in [67], which explains in part LOD\u2019s superior performance at discovering multiple objects. Indeed, in an experiment suggested by reviewer 1AuG, we have observed that LOD\u2019s multi-object discovery performance increases as more regions are considered. On C20K and Op50K datasets, it obtains an AP50 (5.38 and 5.1 resp.) comparable to [67]\u2019s (5.18 and 4.98 resp.) when using only 100 regions per image but reaches significantly better performance when using 200 regions (6.13 and 5.83 resp.) or all regions (6.63 and 6.46 resp.).\n\nThere is a price to pay of course for focusing on the proposal graph instead of the image graph: Our approach foregoes the explicit recovery of the global image collection structure (which images contain the same objects?). However, we demonstrate in the paper that this structure can be recovered later as a post-processing step. We will clarify these points in the paper if it is accepted.\n\n**Q: use of 'supervised features' defeats the purpose/motivation of the 'unsupervised' task. The authors have a nice section on using recent work that doesn't use supervised features, perhaps they should start with that and make that more central**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We are, as far as we know, indeed the first to use self-supervised features to create a fully unsupervised pipeline for UOD. However, since state-of-the-art approaches to UOD report results using supervised features, we have used these features as well in our comparisons. After the submission deadline, we have conducted experiments with self-supervised features on the large Op1.7M dataset and again obtained good performance (CorLoc:49.4, AP50:6.28, AP@[50:95]:1.86). On this dataset, self-supervised features actually fare better than supervised ones (compare to Table 1 in the submission) in single-object discovery and establish a new state-of-the-art performance. We will add these results to Table 1, along with additional discussion on the use of self-supervised features, in order to highlight these points.\n\n**Q: sensitivity analysis to various parameters?**\n\nWe have presented our analysis on the influence of the damping factor $\\beta$ in PageRank and the scalar $\\alpha$ used to select reliable object candidates in LOD in the supplemental material. Following the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we assess below on the C20K and Op50K datasets the sensitivity of LOD to $N$, the number of initial image neighbors, and to $\\gamma$, the parameter controlling the strength of the small perturbation added to the score matrix $W$. For $N$, we have tried different values from 100 to 500 and found that the performance improves only slightly when more neighbors are considered. However, the computational cost increases linearly with $N$ and we find that using 100 neighbors is a good compromise for our datasets. As discussed later, the number of neighbors might need to be changed in case of (undetected) near duplicates or in the case of videos (with successive, highly similar frames). For $\\gamma$, we have varied its value in {$10^{-6}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-2}$} and found that the performance does not vary much ($ < 0.5$\\%) when $\\gamma \\leq 10^{-4}$ and slightly degrades when $\\gamma \\geq 10^{-3}$. This shows that LOD is insensitive to $\\gamma$ as long as it is small enough.\n\n**Q: objectness based on votes of similarity of neighbors, it seems that if two regions are very similar we may get high objectness for both and/or (more generally) if there is a large (semi)clique of very similar regions in different images, we could get high scores. So what if we replicated each image k times in the corpus, would that foil this approach?**\n\nIndeed a large number of replicates, in the limit larger than the number of neighbors used in the optimization, would degrade performance considerably. Note, however, that (1) there are no replicates in the standard benchmarks we use, and (2) in the perhaps more realistic scenario where images would be collected from the web with some, perhaps many exact or close image replicates, we could use an effective near-duplicate image detection method, e.g., (Dong et al., 2012), as a pre-processing step. A similar idea could be used for video datasets. In the video case, random, or better, representative keyframes can be extracted and used as input to LOD.\n\nReference:\nDong, Wei, et al. \"High-confidence near-duplicate image detection.\" ACM ICMR. 2012.\n\n**Q: this approach depends very largely on accuracy of region proposals**\n\nAs is the case for many methods for object detection-related tasks, region proposals are an important component in our pipeline and influence the performance. We have shown in the paper that LOD obtains good results with the proposal algorithm from [67]. However, any unsupervised proposal algorithm can be used in LOD and its performance can be further improved with better proposals.\n\n**Q: 61: do you mean link 'regions' vs 'images' in 'and link images that contain similar objects.' (since an image can contain multiple regions/objects?)**\n\nIn line 61, we describe the approach taken by [67]. It attempts to link images that contain similar objects by optimizing binary variables $e_{pq}$ which represent whether images $p$ and $q$ contain at least one common object.\n\n**Q: 62: does every image have exactly r proposals? It's not clear whether this is variable or fixed. It would be good to give clear (mathematical) definitions too. If r is fixed, what happens to images that should get no or only one or fewer than r proposals?. **\n\nWe assume that each image has exactly $r$ proposals for the sake of simplicity. In practice, we choose up to 2000 proposals per image so that we take essentially all the proposals returned by the proposal algorithm (it is not required that every image has the same number of proposals). On the other hand, we always add the entire image rectangle as a proposal to guarantee that each image has at least one proposal. We will clarify these points in the final version.\n\n**Q: 66: not sufficiently clear, what does 'correspond to visual content shared' mean? what does 'share' mean? This definitely needs to be clarified, since this is problem definition.**\n\nBy \u201cregion proposal $k$ of image $p$ corresponds to visual content shared with its neighbors\u201d we meant \u201cregion proposal $k$ of image $p$ is an object-like region in image p that is similar to an object-like region in one of the neighbors of image p\u201d. This will be clarified in the paper. \n\n**Q: minor: as an aside:why tao and rho are constants.**\n\nWe do not use $\\tau$ and $\\nu$ in our approach (this section describes the previously proposed formulation (C) described in [66,67]). There, $\\tau$ and $\\nu$ serve as constraints that force the model to find the best neighbors and regions.\n\n**Q: 243: Does the user specify M or otherwise, in an unsupervised problem, what can M be in \"we return up to M regions per image, where M is the maximum number of objects in any image in the dataset.\"?**\n\nWe follow another work on object discovery on geometric shapes [43] and assume in our submission that $M$ is known during evaluation. It is 77 in C20K, 90 in C120K, 543 in Op50K and 745 in Op1.7M. In a real application, one would of course use a rough \"budget estimate\" of the upper bound on how many objects per image one may try to detect.\n\n**Q: multi objective performances seem very low, perhaps some discussion of that?**\n\nFinding the right metric to assess multi-object discovery is a complex issue. The CorLoc metric used in single-object discovery, i.e., the precision when only one region is selected per image, is not appropriate in this context. We use Average Precision (AP), a popular metric for object detection, in the multi-object discovery evaluation to avoid the dependence on the number $m$ of selected regions per image, unlike [67] which computes recall at a fixed value of $m$. We acknowledge that the definition of AP given in our submission is vague and may be misleading. To be more precise, the notion of AP used in all our experiments is correctly defined as the area under the precision-recall curve where precision and recall are computed for each value of $m$ from 1 to $M$ (the maximum number of ground-truth objects per image). Since the precision decreases significantly with increasing $m$, the performance numbers appear much smaller than in the single-object case. As noted in the paper, UOD is still a very challenging task due to the lack of supervision and the multi-object discovery performance is relatively low for all methods. ",

    "review": "The paper contains a trove of fascinating results. The main results characterize integer scoring rules and their asymptotic behavior with respect to Condorcet consistency and participation, and the appendix give a range of additional results characterizing participation for other prominent voting rules. The paper makes a convincing case in the introduction that these (fairly abstract) characterizations have plenty of implications that social-choice researchers should care about, such as new results for participation under impartial culture and general take-aways for the relative likelihood of violations of the two properties (where it is known that Condorcet consistency and participation cannot be simultaneously guaranteed for 4 and more items).\nAt least as important is Lemma 1, an abstracted version of the results by Xia 2021, which builds the foundation of the previous results, but is also clearly applicable to axioms other than participation and Condorcet consistency. I cannot judge how much of that generality was already present in Xia 2021, but, if this is indeed new, this seems like a big and valuable contribution that can likely draw a whole string of papers behind it.\n\nA first comment that I have is that I think the term \"smoothed analysis\" is a misleading description of what the paper does. I realize, of course, that this terminology is taken over from Xia 2020 (where another reviewer pointed out the same thing [1]), but I think it would be a service to the community to adapt the terminology. In smoothed analysis as introduced by Spielman and Teng, (a) a worst-case instance is randomly perturbed and (b) results are analyzed as a function of both n and sigma, the variance of the noise. By contrast, Xia's model presumes a menu of distributions and then has an adversary combine these distributions; and the paper does not analyze the dependency on the \"noise\" (here: the epsilon in the definition of a strictly-positive single-agent preference model).\nI think a better terminology would be to call the model a semi-random model since it interleaves worst-case and probabilistic steps. In the literature on semi-random models, adversarial and probabilistic steps have been interleaved in many different ways (see, for example, Section 2.3 of this paper by Kolla, Makarychev, and Makarychev [2]). None of this should be understood as a critique of the model, and I think that the model indeed is useful for similar reasons as a smoothed-analysis model, which makes sense that both models are semi-random. Still, the term smoothed analysis is misleading and should be avoided.\n\nMy second concern is with the presentation of the paper. My impression is that the nine-page format does this paper a real disservice. The authors clearly know their craft, but the space constraints riddle the paper with abbreviations, quick sequences of theorem environments, and a lot of the paper \"tells rather than shows\", which is natural given the 60 pages of theoretical appendices and the fact that Theorems 3\u20136 don't even fit into the body. While reading, I was missing more signposting of what was up ahead, and more patient discussions relating the results (the introduction does this very well, I just would have liked more of it). Within these constraints, the exposition is clear, but it is a harder read than it would have to be with extra pages, and I am concerned that there is to little space to reflect on the results and make them shine. I don't think this is reason enough to reject the paper, but I think it severely limits the usefulness of the paper as printed at NeurIPS. I strongly encourage the authors to publish a longer, more patient version on arxiv/in a journal to maximize the impact of the work.\n\n\nSmaller comments:\n- I think \\Theta(1) /\\ 1 - Theta(1) should be spelled out somewhere: for large enough n, the probabilities will be bounded by some constants alpha, beta with 0 < alpha < beta < 1.\n- In Figure 1, the formulation \"other ranking w.p. 1/8\" was very misleading to me. After reading a section coming much later, I think this is supposed to mean that \"every other ranking\" has probability 1/8 (the adding-up-to-1 constraint was less obvious to me given that your weighted preference profiles don't have normalized weights). Moreover, I'm pretty sure that the weighted majority graph should have weights 1/8 rather than 1/4.\n- in line 254, it wasn't clear to me what in the condition corresponds to the \"small perturbation\", this deserves more details.\n- based on the introduction, I would have expected Lemma 1 to appear before the main results rather than after. I think this should be signposted in the sections where the main results appear.\n- the first paragraph of Section 3 did little to explain what was the goal of the section, and instead paraphrased the immediately following definition 2. This paraphrase threw me off rather than helping me.\n- a whole range of abbreviations were undefined at first use (there might be some false positives): ANR in line 142, MRSE is used in line 181 before being introduced in line 190, CH in line 240, PMV in line 324 is only defined in line 361.\n- in the equation in line 240, for example, many sets are intersected with A \\setminus r(\\pi). It seems easier to just subtract the set r(\\pi), which is equivalent.\n- typo: \"Condocetified\" in line 336, \"sutdied\" in line 379\n\n\u2013\u2013\n[1] https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/7e05d6f828574fbc975a896b25bb011e-Review.html\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3806.pdf",
    "comment": "We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s time and thoughtful feedback!\n\nRe. First concern. The reviewer is absolutely correct about the difference between the setting of smoothed analysis by Spielman and Teng and the setting of this paper. Semi-random model is an awesome name (thanks for the suggestion!). We will make the change throughout the paper, and specifically the title will be changed to \u201cThe Semi-Random Satisfaction of Voting Axioms\u201d. We will also add discussions on its connection to smoothed analysis and why we used a different terminology than Xia 2020. As a side note, at a high level our setting can be translated to the setting by Spielman and Teng, by modeling the input by the normalized anonymized profile (i.e., the histogram of an n-profile divided by n), and then viewing the noise as (approximated) Gaussian with diminishing sigma at the rate of \\sqrt n, in light of various multi-dimensional Berry-Esseen-type theorems. That said, we found the semi-random name suggested by the reviewer a better alternative. Thanks for the suggestion again!\n\nRe. Second concern. We will submit the full version to a journal and put it online as the suggested. We will also proofread and polish the paper (including addressing all \u201cSmaller concerns\u201d raised by the reviewer) to further optimize the presentation under the page limit. \n\nRe. Limitations. We will add more discussions as mentioned in our response to Reviewer XDdy.\n\nSide comment on Lemma 1 vs. Xia 2021. Technically, Lemma 1 is a somewhat straightforward application and combination of  the main theorem in Xia 2021 to the union of finitely many polyhedra and their complements. We believe that it\u2019s main contribution is conceptual (as briefly discussed in L145 and L369), because as the reviewer observed, it provides a high-level picture on what can be expected about the satisfaction of other axioms (while the direct applications of the main result in Xia 2021 would not distinguish the three Theta(1) cases in Lemma 1 of this paper, i.e., M, L, and VL). The main technical contribution of this paper is the applications of Lemma 1 to CC and Par (instead of proving Lemma 1 itself).\n",

      "The paper contains a trove of fascinating results.",
      "The main results characterize integer scoring rules and their asymptotic behavior with respect to Condorcet consistency and participation, and the appendix give a range of additional results characterizing participation for other prominent voting rules.",
      "The paper makes a convincing case in the introduction that these (fairly abstract) characterizations have plenty of implications that social-choice researchers should care about, such as new results for participation under impartial culture and general take-aways for the relative likelihood of violations of the two properties (where it is known that Condorcet consistency and participation cannot be simultaneously guaranteed for 4 and more items).",
      "At least as important is Lemma 1, an abstracted version of the results by Xia 2021, which builds the foundation of the previous results, but is also clearly applicable to axioms other than participation and Condorcet consistency.",
      "I cannot judge how much of that generality was already present in Xia 2021, but, if this is indeed new, this seems like a big and valuable contribution that can likely draw a whole string of papers behind it.",
      "A first comment that I have is that I think the term 'smoothed analysis' is a misleading description of what the paper does.",
      "I realize, of course, that this terminology is taken over from Xia 2020 (where another reviewer pointed out the same thing [1]), but I think it would be a service to the community to adapt the terminology.",
      "In smoothed analysis as introduced by Spielman and Teng, (a) a worst-case instance is randomly perturbed and (b) results are analyzed as a function of both n and sigma, the variance of the noise.",
      "By contrast, Xia's model presumes a menu of distributions and then has an adversary combine these distributions; and the paper does not analyze the dependency on the 'noise' (here: the epsilon in the definition of a strictly-positive single-agent preference model).",
      "I think a better terminology would be to call the model a semi-random model since it interleaves worst-case and probabilistic steps.",
      "In the literature on semi-random models, adversarial and probabilistic steps have been interleaved in many different ways (see, for example, Section 2.3 of this paper by Kolla, Makarychev, and Makarychev [2]).",
      "None of this should be understood as a critique of the model, and I think that the model indeed is useful for similar reasons as a smoothed-analysis model, which makes sense that both models are semi-random.",
      "Still, the term 'smoothed analysis' is misleading and should be avoided.",
      "My second concern is with the presentation of the paper.",
      "My impression is that the nine-page format does this paper a real disservice.",
      "The authors clearly know their craft, but the space constraints riddle the paper with abbreviations, quick sequences of theorem environments, and a lot of the paper 'tells rather than shows', which is natural given the 60 pages of theoretical appendices and the fact that Theorems 3\u20136 don't even fit into the body.",
      "While reading, I was missing more signposting of what was up ahead, and more patient discussions relating the results (the introduction does this very well, I just would have liked more of it).",
      "Within these constraints, the exposition is clear, but it is a harder read than it would have to be with extra pages, and I am concerned that there is too little space to reflect on the results and make them shine.",
      "I don't think this is reason enough to reject the paper, but I think it severely limits the usefulness of the paper as printed at NeurIPS.",
      "I strongly encourage the authors to publish a longer, more patient version on arxiv/in a journal to maximize the impact of the work.",
      "Smaller comments:",
      "I think \u0398(1) /= 1 - \u0398(1) should be spelled out somewhere: for large enough n, the probabilities will be bounded by some constants alpha, beta with 0 < alpha < beta < 1.",
      "In Figure 1, the formulation 'other ranking w.p. 1/8' was very misleading to me.",
      "After reading a section coming much later, I think this is supposed to mean that 'every other ranking' has probability 1/8 (the adding-up-to-1 constraint was less obvious to me given that your weighted preference profiles don't have normalized weights).",
      "Moreover, I'm pretty sure that the weighted majority graph should have weights 1/8 rather than 1/4.",
      "In line 254, it wasn't clear to me what in the condition corresponds to the 'small perturbation', this deserves more details.",
      "Based on the introduction, I would have expected Lemma 1 to appear before the main results rather than after. I think this should be signposted in the sections where the main results appear.",
      "The first paragraph of Section 3 did little to explain what was the goal of the section, and instead paraphrased the immediately following Definition 2.",
      "This paraphrase threw me off rather than helping me.",
      "A whole range of abbreviations were undefined at first use (there might be some false positives): ANR in line 142, MRSE is used in line 181 before being introduced in line 190, CH in line 240, PMV in line 324 is only defined in line 361.",
      "In the equation in line 240, for example, many sets are intersected with A \\ setminus r(\u03c0).",
      "It seems easier to just subtract the set r(\u03c0), which is equivalent.",
      "Typo: 'Condocetified' in line 336, 'sutdied' in line 379"

We believe that the assumptions (of strict positiveness and closedness) are mild, though it is definitely an important and interesting open question to extend the analysis to variable \\epsilon, and perhaps establish bounds that explicitly depend on \\epsilon.\n\nRe. Other axioms. The analysis of this paper (applications of Lemma 1) can be performed for any axiom under any rule that can be represented by the union of finitely many polyhedral, which we believe to cover a wide range of situations. Section 4 intended to demonstrate this possibility, and some observations and discussions were made in Appendix B (where the definitions of some axioms naturally lead to their polyhedral representations, while some may not have straightforward polyhedral representations). We believe that even for axioms in Appendix B that admit natural polyhedral representations under some commonly-studied voting rules, developing conditions and characterizing the degree of polynomial like in the theorems in this paper can still be highly challenging and non-trivial even in light of Lemma 1. These are natural and interesting topics for future work.\n\nWe will add more concrete and explicit discussions about the limitations and possible generalizations to other axioms in the revision.\n",
